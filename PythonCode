I have three main CSV files:

1. `cpng_column_sample_summary.csv`  
   – Contains column names and sample values from the legacy CPNG database.  
   – It has one sheet with all tables and columns listed by name, with one sample value per column.

2. `dctrack_asset_templates.csv`  
   – Contains DC-TRACK asset structure.  
   – Each sheet represents a single asset type (e.g., DC Plant, UPS, PDU, etc.) with column names and sample values.

3. `cpng_full_dump.csv`  
   – Contains legacy CPNG data for all tables.  
   – Only 2–3 rows per table (sample data for MSC location: LAHSER).  
   – This was used to generate `cpng_column_sample_summary.csv`.

4. Reference file: `cpng_relationship_notes.txt`  
   – Contains relationship understanding across CPNG tables, based on our manual ERD analysis.

### OBJECTIVE:

Map each **CPNG column** to the most appropriate **DC-TRACK asset column**.

Use logic based on:
- Sample value similarity (`cpng_full_dump.csv` vs `dctrack_asset_templates.csv`)
- Column name and semantic meaning
- Table name relevance (e.g., TBL_DC_PLANT from CPNG maps to “DC Plant” asset sheet in DC-TRACK)

---

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

**One output sheet per DC-TRACK asset**, with the following structure:

| DC-TRACK Column Name | CPNG Table Name | CPNG Column Name | Mapped? (Yes/No) | Matching CPNG Column (if any) |

Notes:
- DC-TRACK columns should be the primary reference.
- If multiple CPNG columns are potential matches, list the best one (or top 2) in `Matching CPNG Column`.
- Highlight unmapped DC-TRACK columns clearly.
- Use a different color or flag (like “?” or “TBD”) for uncertain mappings.

---

### Additional References:
- Use the last sheet of `cpng_full_dump.csv` (ER diagram data).
- Use `cpng_relationship_msc_lahser.sql` for a working query example for one MSC site.

---

### STARTING POINT:

Start with the most obvious asset types first:  
**DC Plant, BDFB, PDU, UPS**

Once these mappings are clear, proceed to other assets.

Goal is to help automate the column-level mapping for migration.

I have two Excel files:
1. `cpng_column_sample_summary.xlsx` – This contains column names and sample values from legacy CPNG database. It has a single sheet with all tables listed by name.
2. `dctrac_asset_templates.xlsx` – This contains DC-TRAC asset structure. Each sheet represents one type of asset (e.g., DC Plant, UPS, PDU, etc.) with column names and sample values.

I want you to map the columns from CPNG to the most appropriate DC-TRAC asset and column. The logic can use:
- Sample value similarity
- Column name meaning
- Table name to asset relevance (e.g., TBL_DC_PLANT maps to DC Plant sheet)

Please output the final mapping in this format:
- CPNG Table Name
- CPNG Column Name
- Mapped DC-TRAC Asset Sheet
- Mapped DC-TRAC Column Name

You can also reference the relationships present in the original schema if needed (like UPS to RPP, or PDU to Breaker).
You can also refer to this file: `cpng_relationship_notes.txt` for relationships between tables.
Please start with the most obvious mappings for DC Plant, PDU, and UPS.

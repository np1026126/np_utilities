Here’s a polished draft email you can send to the Sunbird team (Kyle and Kailash) that combines your Rule 1 request along with your new clarification on redundancy and mirrored RPP panels, while also requesting a working session today.

Subject: Request for Working Session on DC Track Rules and Redundancy Clarifications

Dear Kyle and Kailash,

I hope you are doing well.

As discussed earlier, we wanted to follow up on a few points regarding DC Track configuration and rule setup, and would like to request a working session with you today if possible to clarify these in detail.

Rule 1 – Roll-up of Budget Consumed Values
We would like your confirmation and guidance on implementing hierarchical roll-up of budget consumed values in DC Track:

RPP Panel → RPP: Budget consumed values of breakers under an RPP panel should sum up at the RPP panel level, and all panels roll up to the RPP.

RPP → Floor PDU: Budget consumed values of all RPPs connected to a Floor PDU should roll up and reflect at the Floor PDU level.

Floor PDU → UPS Bank: Budget consumed values at the Floor PDU should further roll up and reflect at the UPS Bank level, since in the AC flow the PDU is connected to the UPS Bank (not directly to the UPS).


Additional Clarification – Redundancy & Mirrored RPP Panels
We also need clarification on handling redundancy at the Floor PDU level. Specifically:

When redundancy is defined at the Floor PDU, the corresponding RPP panels are created as mirrored pairs.

If a load is added to one RPP panel, how can that same load be automatically reflected to its redundant/mirrored panel in DC Track?


This is critical for ensuring accurate capacity tracking across redundant paths.

Request for a Working Session
Could you kindly let us know if there is any availability today for a short working session to walk through these questions? We would like to ensure alignment on the approach before moving forward.

Thank you for your support, and we look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to also reframe this as a Slack message version (shorter, direct, with pointers) so you can ping them quickly, and then follow up with this detailed mail?

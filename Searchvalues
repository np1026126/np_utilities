Got it 👍
This is a classic site-survey clarification scenario, and the vendors’ questions are actually reasonable. What you need now is a clear, authoritative “what to fill / what is optional / what is not applicable” guidance that you can send back.

Below I’ve structured this in vendor-friendly language, aligned to DCTrack / network standards, and practical from a site-survey point of view.

You can copy-paste sections directly into email or a clarification document.


---

1️⃣ Rails Used – What should they provide?

Vendor confusion:

> Rails are not numbered / not standard → marked as N/A



✅ Correct guidance to give them:

Rails Used is OPTIONAL and informational only.

Tell them:

> If the equipment is rack-mounted and rails are present, please specify Standard / Vendor Rails / Adjustable Rails.

If rails are not applicable, unknown, or equipment is floor-mounted / free-standing, you can mark this as N/A.



Examples they can use:

Standard 19-inch rack rails

Vendor supplied rails

Adjustable rails

N/A (floor-mounted / free-standing)


➡️ This field is NOT blocking ingestion or migration


---

2️⃣ U-Position – What should they enter?

Vendor confusion:

> Should it be above/below, 1, 2, etc.?



✅ Correct guidance:

U-Position is required ONLY for rack-mounted equipment.

Tell them:

> If rack-mounted → provide starting U position (numeric value, e.g., 1, 2, 20)

If the equipment spans multiple U’s → provide starting U

If floor-mounted / free-standing → mark N/A




Examples:

U Position: 10

U Position: 1

N/A (floor-mounted)


➡️ Above/below is NOT required
➡️ Exact height precision is NOT mandatory


---

3️⃣ Generator → ATS relationship (they asked this correctly)

They are right here.

Correct confirmation to give them:

> The relationship between Generator and ATS is defined via the Object Parent Relationship table on the ATS Switch.

No separate relationship entry is required from the Generator side.



✅ They should:

Capture Generator details

Capture ATS details

Relationship will be inferred via ATS mapping



---

4️⃣ Busway vs RPP – Important clarification (VERY IMPORTANT)

You are 100% correct.

Clear instruction to vendors:

> Busway should NOT be modeled as an RPP.



Correct modeling approach:

Busway:

Object Type: Panel

Panel Type: Busway

Location: Floor PDU / IT room


Busway Outlet (Tap Box):

Each 3-pole breaker = 1 Busway Outlet

One outlet per breaker position

Outlet represents a tap box

Each tap box contains only one breaker


What they should NOT do:

❌ Do not create multiple breakers under one outlet
❌ Do not model busway as RPP

✔️ Your sample sheet is correct — attach it and say:

> “Please follow the attached Busway sample for modeling.”




---

5️⃣ Battery Bay vs Battery Plant

Correct answer (simple & firm):

> Battery Bay is NOT required.
Battery Plant IS required.



They should:

Capture Battery Plant

Skip Battery Bay entirely



---

6️⃣ Orientation – What should they fill?

Vendor confusion:

> Orientation column not filled



Correct guidance:

Orientation refers to equipment facing, not rack layout.

They can use:

Front-facing

Rear-facing

Side-facing

N/A


➡️ If unknown, Front-facing is acceptable
➡️ Orientation is NOT mandatory


---

7️⃣ DC Plant – Load & Capacity fields (Plymouth)

This is an important one.

What they CAN realistically provide:

Field	What to provide

Total Load (Current Load)	From plant meter / monitoring
Polled Load (Amps / kW)	If plant is metered (most are)
Anticipated Load	Optional (if known)
Engineered Capacity	Nameplate / design capacity


Clarification you should give them:

> Current Load / Polled Load can be taken from plant meters

Engineered Capacity is the design / rated capacity of the DC plant

If anticipated load is not available, it can be left blank




Engineer Capacity example:

Rectifier plant rated at 2000A, 4000A, etc.



---

8️⃣ Battery Discharge VPC – What value to use?

Industry-accepted values:

1.75 VPC → conservative

1.85 VPC → common telecom standard


What to tell them:

> Use 1.75 or 1.85 VPC based on site standard.
If unknown, 1.75 VPC is acceptable.




---

9️⃣ Target Run Time (Hours)

Acceptable values:

3 hours

5 hours


Tell them:

> Please provide the target runtime as per site standard.
If unknown, default to 3 hours.




---

🔟 Utility Feed / Transformer – What is mandatory?

These ARE REQUIRED and should be obtainable:

Field	What they must provide

Rating (kVA)	Nameplate
Rating (kW)	Nameplate
Source	Utility / Generator / Substation
Source Location	Where transformer is physically located


Tell them:

> Transformer ratings and source details should be available on the nameplate or site documentation and must be provided.




---

✅ Suggested FINAL Vendor Guidance Summary (Short)

You can paste this as a closing paragraph:

> To summarize:

Rails Used / Orientation / Anticipated Load are optional

U-Position is required only for rack-mounted equipment

Busway must be modeled as Panel → Busway, not RPP

One Busway Outlet per 3-pole breaker

Battery Plant is required; Battery Bay is not

Generator → ATS relationship is handled via ATS

DC Plant loads can be sourced from meters; engineered capacity from nameplate

Utility / Transformer ratings and source details are required

If you want, next I can:

Convert this into a clean PDF / 1-pager for vendors

Draft a polite but firm email using this content

Create a “What to Fill / What to Skip” table only
Perfect, this screenshot actually helps a lot 👍
I’ll answer this in three clear parts, exactly mapping to what the site survey vendors are confused about, and what you should tell them to fill.


---

1️⃣ Utility Feed → Transformer (Source & Source Location)

You are absolutely correct, and your modeling is right.

✅ What you should tell them (very clearly):

Utility Feed is the source

Transformer source must reference the Utility Feed name

Transformer source location must be the location of the Utility Feed


How to fill it (example):

Object	Field	Value

Utility Feed	Name	MAIN-USD
Utility Feed	Location	Outside / Yard / Electrical Room
Transformer	Source	MAIN-USD – Utility Feed
Transformer	Source Location	Same as Utility Feed location


📌 Rule

> Transformer source must always point to the Utility Feed object that feeds it.



You can say this line verbatim:

> “Transformer source should always reference the Utility Feed name, and the Utility Feed location should be used as the source location.”




---

2️⃣ Rails Used & U-Position (Rectifiers / DC Equipment)

This is where the diagram they shared matters, and your answer should be firm but simple.

What the diagram shows

Rectifiers / power bays

Equipment mounted inside a power bay

Slots / positions exist, but not standard 19-inch rack U numbering


✅ Correct guidance for DCTrack / Network systems

🔹 Rails Used

For rectifiers / power bays:

✔ Use:

N/A

OR Integrated bay rails


❌ Do NOT try to invent rail numbers
❌ Do NOT map them like IT racks

📌 Why:

> DC power bays have integrated mounting, not removable rack rails.




---

🔹 U-Position

For rectifiers / DC plant equipment:

✔ Use:

N/A


📌 Why:

U-position applies to standard IT racks

DC bays use panel/slot positions, not rack U’s


What you should explicitly tell them:

> “For rectifiers and DC power bays, Rails Used and U-Position are not applicable. These are integrated bays, not standard rack-mounted equipment.”




---

3️⃣ What if they want to provide something (optional guidance)

If the vendor insists on filling something (some tools force it):

Field	Allowed value

Rails Used	Integrated bay rails
U-Position	N/A


This will not block ingestion and is accepted practice.


---

4️⃣ How to explain the diagram they referenced

You can address their diagram question directly:

> “The diagram shows panel positions within a DC power bay, not rack U-positions. These panel positions are internal to the bay and are not captured as U-positions in DCTrack.”



This sentence alone clears 90% of the confusion.


---

5️⃣ One clean paragraph you can send to vendors (recommended)

You can copy-paste this as-is:

> For Utility and Transformer modeling, the Transformer source should always reference the Utility Feed name (e.g., MAIN-USD), and the Utility Feed location should be used as the source location.

For Rectifiers and DC power bays, Rails Used and U-Position are not applicable. These are integrated power bays and do not follow standard IT rack rail or U-numbering conventions. The panel/slot positions shown in the diagrams are internal to the bay and are not captured as U-positions in DCTrack. If required by the form, Rails Used may be entered as “Integrated bay rails” and U-Position as “N/A”.




---

6️⃣ Short confirmation (for your own confidence)

✔ Your utility → transformer chaining is correct
✔ Your decision to mark rails/U-position as N/A is correct
✔ The vendors’ confusion is understandable, but they should not invent values


---

If you want, next I can:

Convert this into a 1-page vendor clarification PDF

Draft a very short “final instruction” email

Review any other column they’re questioning and mark it Mandatory / Optional / N/A


Just tell me 👍

Got it. I’ve carefully read Jessica’s clarification, Jason/Jamie’s follow-up, and your explanation about the New Berlin cooling zones. I’ll break this into three clear parts so you can respond with confidence and also clear the technical confusion.


---

1️⃣ What is Jason/Jamie actually confused about?

Jason’s confusion is valid and very common in site-survey → inventory workflows.

His main doubts are:

1. What exactly is a “Cooling Zone”?


2. Should sensible capacity be entered per CRAC/CRAH unit or per room/zone?


3. He noticed CRAC units and is asking:

> “If CRACs exist, shouldn’t the sensible capacity be derived from them instead of room-level values?”





So he’s basically asking:

> “Am I filling cooling data at equipment level or at room/zone level?”




---

2️⃣ What is the correct functional explanation (you should tell him)?

This is the key clarification you must give 👇

✅ What is a Cooling Zone (in DC Track / Network context)?

You can explain it like this (simple + accurate):

> A Cooling Zone represents the logical area (room/space) where cooling is applied and managed as a group, not an individual CRAC unit.

The sensible capacity at the cooling zone level represents the total effective cooling available to that room/zone, regardless of how many CRAC/CRAH units feed it.



Important distinction (this removes his confusion):

Concept	Meaning

CRAC / CRAH	Individual cooling equipment
Cooling Zone	Room or area being cooled
Cooling Zone Sensible Capacity	Sum / effective cooling available to that room


So he is NOT expected to calculate CRAC-by-CRAC capacity unless explicitly asked.

3️⃣ About the values (200, 148, 2, 1) – are they acceptable?

Yes — based on what you described, your position is correct.

Facts you can confidently state:

Out of 15 locations, users (LEI-provided data) explicitly identified 4 rooms as having cooling zones

For those 4 rooms, users provided:

Cooling Zone Name = Room Name

Sensible Capacity values = 200, 148, 2, 1


These values are user-provided authoritative inputs

Your team has not assumed or derived these values


So your stance should be:

> “We are using exactly what the users provided. We are not inferring or recalculating.”



That is 100% defensible.


---

4️⃣ What about Jason’s CRAC question — is he wrong?

No — he’s thinking logically, but from a different layer.

You should acknowledge this and guide him:

CRAC-level data can be useful

But it is optional unless users ask for recalculation

Zone-level data does not need CRAC breakdown


You can also invite him to share CRAC details if available.


---

5️⃣ What EXACTLY should you reply to Jason?

Here is a ready-to-send reply that:

Clarifies cooling zone meaning

Confirms the 4-room data

Addresses CRAC confusion politely

Keeps responsibility with user-provided data

Leaves door open for more info

✅ Suggested Reply (Professional + Clear)

Subject: RE: Cooling Zone & Sensible Capacity – New Berlin

> Hi Jason,

Thanks for the clarification — your question makes sense, so let me align everyone on how we’re treating cooling zones for New Berlin.

In DC Track, a Cooling Zone is defined at the room/area level, not at the individual CRAC/CRAH unit level. The sensible capacity captured for a cooling zone represents the total effective cooling available to that room, regardless of how many CRAC units support it.

For the New Berlin site, out of the 15 locations, the user-provided (LEI) data explicitly identified 4 rooms as having cooling zones. For those rooms:

Cooling Zone Name = Room Name

Sensible Capacity values provided = 200, 148, 2, and 1


These values were directly provided by the users, and we have carried them forward as-is without deriving or recalculating from CRAC-level data.

If additional CRAC/CRAH details are available and you’d like to share them, we’re happy to review and confirm with the users whether any refinement is needed. Otherwise, we will proceed using the user-provided cooling zone values.

Please let us know if you see any discrepancies or have additional inputs.

Thanks,
Naveen

6️⃣ One-line explanation you can reuse elsewhere (very useful)

> Cooling zone sensible capacity represents room-level cooling availability, not individual CRAC unit capacity.

If you want, I can also:

Rewrite this in a more technical tone

Shorten it for Slack

Prepare a diagram explanation you can attach


Just tell me 👍

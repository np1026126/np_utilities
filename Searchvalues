Subject: Status Update ‚Äì Asset Data Migration to DC-TRACK

Dear All,

Please find the latest update on the data migration activities related to IFP, CPNG, and FUZE systems into DC-TRACK.

üîπ Asset Mapping Summary:

IFP: 8 assets have been mapped to DC-TRACK.

CPNG: 7 assets have been mapped to DC-TRACK.

FUZE: 5 assets have been identified for mapping into DC-TRACK.


üîπ Progress Details:

1. IFP Migration:

Mapping between IFP assets and DC-TRACK mandatory columns has been completed.

Data extraction queries have been developed for all 8 IFP assets in the Holistic Template format, which includes required DC-TRACK fields and default values where applicable.

The query has been shared with Suresh, who is currently working on extracting IFP data for 144 MSP locations in this format.



2. CPNG Migration:

Mapping for 7 CPNG assets to DC-TRACK columns has been finalized.

I have refined and validated the extraction query for the BDFB asset to ensure accurate results (attached to this email).

Suresh has shared responses for 6 of the assets. I will be validating and importing this data into DC-TRACK to identify any fallouts or format issues.



3. FUZE Migration:

Although we do not have direct access to FUZE data due to data compliance restrictions offshore, 5 assets have been identified for mapping to DC-TRACK.

I am actively collaborating with Suresh to obtain necessary table and column mappings and will be preparing the query in the Holistic Template format, with auto-populated default values to ensure readiness for import into DC-TRACK.

This FUZE query will be delivered by end of day.




üîπ Next Steps:

Once FUZE mapping is delivered, we will have Holistic Template-ready data for all three systems (IFP, CPNG, and FUZE) aligned to DC-TRACK‚Äôs structure.

Suresh is also working to enhance the extracted IFP and CPNG data for all 144 MSP locations by:

Applying color coding to differentiate between mandatory fields, user-mandatory fields for Wireline, and default values.


In parallel, data for an additional 12 locations will be provided by Andrej.


Please let me know if any further information is required.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like this formatted as a table or PowerPoint for presentation as well.
want to send a professional email to my manager, senior manager, onshore leads, and higher-level stakeholders updating them on the status of our data asset migration project.

Please refactor the following draft to make it clear, well-structured, and professional in tone. Make sure to clearly mention the asset counts for IFP (8 assets), CPNG (7 assets), and FUZE (5 assets), and include what Suresh and Andrej are working on:

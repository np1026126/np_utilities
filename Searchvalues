Got it 👍
You’re basically asking for a clean, authoritative “what to fill / what to ignore” explanation, with one-line definitions that you can send to the site survey team so they don’t overthink or overfill fields.

Below is a structured, copy-paste-ready guide, exactly aligned to what you described.
Anything not explicitly mentioned = NOT REQUIRED / can be left blank.

Custom Field – kW
👉 Rated real power output of the generator in kilowatts (kW).

Custom Field – Rating / Capacity
👉 Total nameplate capacity of the generator.

Custom Field – Maximum Load

UPS Bank

📌 All fields are NOT required.


---

🔌 LOAD DEVICE – UPS → UPS BANK → PDU

UPS → UPS Bank

---

🚌 BUSWAY

Busway is modeled as a panel under Floor PDU.

Each Busway = Busway Panel

Each Tap-off = Busway Outlet

Each Breaker = Breaker Connection


📌 You will provide a sample Excel with:

1. Busway Panel


2. Busway Outlet (Tap box)


3. Breaker Connection



📌 Only fields in that sample need to be filled.

Engineered Capacity
👉 Designed maximum current capacity.

Discharge VPC
👉 Voltage per cell during discharge (1.75 or 1.85).

Target Run Time (Hours)

Subject: Migration Status Update – NEC Breaker Fallouts & Next Steps

Body:

Hello Team,

As part of today’s migration updates, here is the consolidated status and the next steps:


---

1. Completed Activities

Several pending items from the previous migration cycle have been completed successfully.

For the NEC sites, we have imported data for RPP, PDU, UPS, UPS Bank, and associated panels as provided by the users.



---

2. NEC Breaker Fallout Details

While importing breaker information (fetched directly from IFP DB), we observed mismatches between the breaker data and the user-provided RPP & RPP panel names.

We have attached a fallout sheet listing:

Locations where RPP/RPP panel names were not found

Cases where panel names didn’t match with IFP DB data

Sites where RPP details were missing for breakers


Some name mismatches (like underscore vs hyphen) have been fixed, but several records still require user input for accurate mapping.



---

3. Support Needed from Andrew

We need Andrew’s help with:

Verifying the RPP & RPP panel names for breaker mapping.

Providing missing data for locations where panel names are not present.

Confirming the correct mapping for records flagged in the fallout sheet.



---

4. Next Steps

Once Andrew provides the corrected data, we will proceed with breaker migration for NEC sites.

We are on track to complete IT follow-ups by Wednesday, provided we receive user inputs on time.



---

Please review the attached fallout sheet for the exact details and let us know when we can expect the corrected inputs.

Thank you,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also create a Slack update version for quick posting in the migration channel with a shorter format.

Do you want me to prepare that Slack message as well? It will be easier for the team to track.

- A single summarized sheet with:  
       - Legends at the top  
       - Categorized issues  
       - Suggested actions  

Please generate this summary in a professional format so it can be shared directly with users.

What This Will Do

Gemini will read your original sheet.

It will categorize all issues into a standard legend.

It will fix simple naming mismatches automatically (like hyphen vs underscore).

It will generate a clean sheet with clear issue descriptions and actions for users.



---

If you want, I can also give you a sample legend structure and final column headers so the output from Gemini looks perfectly standardized.

Do you want me to prepare that sample legend and column structure? It will save you time.

Subject: Floor PDU Power Chain – Update on Panel Configuration

Dear Team,

Following today’s discussion and based on the latest inputs, we are aligning our floor PDU build as per the updated recommendation.

Previously, we created a single local panel within the floor PDU containing 12 poles (4 x 3-pole 600A breakers), sized to 1200A as per the provided diagram. Each breaker was intended to feed separate RPPs (considered as floor PDUs), adhering to the original instruction.

However, during today’s call, a change was proposed to improve clarity and alignment with system standards. Instead of a single panel housing all 4 breakers, we will now create 4 separate panels, each containing one 600A breaker. Each breaker will independently feed one RPP.

We have discussed this change with the relevant stakeholders, and both James Hill and Andrew have confirmed their alignment with the revised approach. Based on their feedback, we will proceed with implementing this change in the power chain design.

Kindly let us know if there are any concerns. Otherwise, we’ll move forward with the updated configuration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Designation / Team, if needed]

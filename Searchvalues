Thanks, that clarification helps a lot. Based on your input and the actual UI behavior from the screenshots, the existing description and ACs are too generic. You want them to accurately reflect the data behavior, conditional field population, and calculations when selecting UPS (AC power type).

Here's a completely revised version of the Description and Acceptance Criteria (AC) including:

UPS-specific fields

PDU/RPP load calculation

Formulas

Dynamic UI behavior

Analysis section logic



---

ðŸ”„ Updated Description

This feature enables the AC Power calculation feasibility within the 1PSC Power Planning UI, specifically when the plant type is selected as UPS (indicating AC power flow). The implementation must ensure that:

The pop-up dynamically renders UPS-specific fields, such as:

UPS kW Rating

Anticipated Output Load

AC Switchboard Capacity (Amps)

Generator Capacity

PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness)


Based on the selected UPS, the corresponding PDUs and RPPs should be auto-populated.

Load and capacity values for PDU and RPP must be computed and displayed using appropriate formulas.

The Analysis section must reflect total load calculations like:

Total UPS Load = Sum of PDU Loads

AC Load = Total Equipment Watts / PUE

Total Generator Load = UPS Load Ã— Load Factor (if applicable)

Future Load = Existing Load + Forecasted Growth (if available)


The interface should prevent errors by showing only valid fields relevant to UPS and hiding or disabling fields that apply only to DC plant types.

âœ… Updated Acceptance Criteria

UPS Selection Behavior

AC-1: When the user selects UPS as the Plant Type in the pop-up, then the following UPS-related fields must be displayed:

UPS kW Rating

Anticipated Output Load (kW)

AC Switchboard Capacity (amps)

Generator Capacity

PUE


All other DC-related fields (like Battery or Rectifier) must be hidden or disabled.


---

PDU & RPP Auto-Population and Load Calculation

AC-2: When a UPS is selected, the corresponding PDUs and RPPs associated with that UPS must be auto-populated in their respective sections, if records exist.

AC-3: The following formulas must be applied:

PDU Load = Sum of load from connected equipment

PDU Max Load = Max permissible load for the PDU

RPP Load = Sum of load from PDUs under that RPP

RPP Max Load = Max permissible load for the RPP


AC-4: If no PDUs or RPPs are found, display "No records found" with an option to associate or refresh connections.


---

Analysis Section Calculations

AC-5: In the Analysis section, the following values must be computed:

Total UPS Load = Sum of all connected PDU Loads

AC Load = Total Equipment Heat / PUE

Total Generator Load = Total UPS Load (if generator is assigned)

Future Load = Total Load + Forecasted Load (if values are given)


AC-6: All percentage utilization values must be calculated correctly and shown as:

Final % Utilization = (Existing + New Load) / Max Capacity Ã— 100


---

Validation and UI Consistency

AC-7: Switching between plant types (UPS vs DC) must clear or disable irrelevant fields and ensure the correct fields and calculations are shown.

AC-8: The dashboard should handle invalid or missing input values gracefully with user-friendly error messages.

Would you like me to create a table view summarizing all formulas and field mappings, or should I help you draft a sample Jira story or feature document with these points?

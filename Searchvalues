Got it. If you want to give Google Gemini (or Copilot) a very clear prompt so it can automatically fix the Fuel Tank Location column using the Production VZW Sites sheet and the rules you’ve explained, here’s a polished prompt you can use:


---

Prompt for Google Gemini or Copilot

I have two Google Sheets:

1. Fuel Tank Assets Sheet – Contains asset data including the "Location" column. Some rows in "Location" have:

Missing 8-digit short names (silly codes)

Incorrect format (e.g., only site name, no room name)

Room names missing or not matching expected names ("ROOF" or "OUTSIDE").



2. Production VZW Sites Sheet – Contains:

8-digit short name (silly code)

Site Name

Room names




I need you to:

1. Compare the Fuel Tank Assets Sheet "Location" column with the Production VZW Sites Sheet.


2. If the 8-digit short name is missing but site name exists, find the matching site in the Production VZW Sites Sheet and insert the correct 8-digit short name.


3. If both short name and room name are missing or wrong, insert the short name from the Production sheet and a room name as either "ROOF" or "OUTSIDE" based on availability.


4. The final format for "Location" must always be:

<8-digit short name> > <Room Name>

Example: ABCD1234 > ROOF


5. Keep all other data in the Fuel Tank sheet unchanged.


6. Return a corrected version of the Fuel Tank sheet with updated "Location" values.

If you want, I can also create a ready-to-use Apps Script or Python code so that you can directly run this automation on your sheets.

Do you want me to prepare that script for you? It will fix the locations automatically.

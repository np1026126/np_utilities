Perfect — this is exactly the right move 👍
I’ll give you a clean, professional, calm-but-firm version that works both as:
a Slack ping to the Sunbird employee, and
a ticket comment (you can reuse most of it verbatim).
I’ll keep it non-accusatory, aligned with what your manager and ADs are saying, and clearly place ownership on Sunbird without sounding aggressive.
Polished Slack / Ticket Message (Recommended)
Hi <Name>,
I wanted to follow up on the Float Voltage migration discussion and update you based on inputs from my senior management and ADs.
Since the new standard Float Voltage field was introduced as part of a DC Track product change, and the existing values already reside within DC Track (previously under a custom field), the expectation is that the migration of existing data from the deprecated custom field to the new standard field should be handled by Sunbird as part of the release or a patch.
This is a deterministic, one-time data migration with no customer-specific business logic involved. Asking customers to build schedulers or perform manual export/import activities introduces operational risk, additional cost, and potential data integrity issues—especially since these values are actively used in calculations.
From our side, we’d prefer this to be addressed at the platform level to ensure consistency and avoid customer-side workarounds. Could you please check internally if there is an existing or planned mechanism to migrate values from the old custom field into the new standard Float Voltage field?
Thanks for checking on this, and happy to discuss further if needed.

Hi <Name>, quick follow-up on Float Voltage migration. Based on inputs from our senior management, since the standard field was introduced by DC Track and the data already exists in the platform, the expectation is that Sunbird handles the migration from the deprecated custom field as part of the release/patch.
Customer-side schedulers or manual export/imports add risk and cost, especially for values used in calculations. Could you please check if there’s an internal or planned migration for this?
Why this wording works
✔ Mentions senior management & ADs (signals escalation without threatening)
✔ Frames it as a platform responsibility, not blame
✔ Avoids emotional or contractual language
✔ Leaves room for Sunbird to respond constructively
✔ Safe to paste directly into the ticket comments
If you want, next I can:
Make this even more executive-level
Rewrite it as a formal escalation note
Help you prepare talking points for a call with Sunbird
Just tell me how hard you want to push 🚀

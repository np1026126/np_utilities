⭐ Innovation & Org Initiatives (Final Workday Version)

Initiated and championed the use of AI tools (GitHub Copilot & Google Gemini) to automate and optimize multiple development and migration workflows across 1PSC. These AI-driven initiatives significantly improved accuracy, reduced manual effort, and accelerated overall delivery.

Key Innovation Contributions

Integrated AI automation into the wireless migration process, including:

Schema mapping across IFP, CPNG, and FUSE

Auto-generation of 28 SQL assets for three DBs

Automated extraction of 142 location data

Auto-creation of DC-Track import templates


Delivered 99% accurate migration sheets using AI mapping + automated transformations, reducing fallout to <1% and eliminating multiple cycles of rework.

Created a reusable AI-based migration framework that can be applied for future PSC, CNB, ELS, and wireline migrations—reducing cost and effort for upcoming programs.


AI in Integration & Sync Initiatives

Designed and implemented 10+ DC-Track ↔ CND APIs, enabling smooth bidirectional sync for:

Cabinet creation

Budget load updates

Asset updates

XML-based orchestration flows


Automated the fallback fix for breaker → cabinet fallout using a Gemini-generated script that pushed corrections directly via DC-Track APIs.

Used Copilot to optimize logic for transformation, mapping validation, and story development across modules.


Organizational Innovation & Hackathon Participation

Proposed and presented innovative Hackathon ideas, including:

Automated regression validation

Missed data detection using AI

Auto-generation of holistic templates

AI-based asset relationship prediction
Even though the idea was not selected, it was well-received and encouraged by peers.


Regularly brainstorm AI-centric improvements for data stability, migration tooling, and quality assurance.


Driving Continuous Improvement Across the Org

Championed the adoption of AI tools across the team, helping peers understand and apply Copilot/Gemini for:

Code generation

Query optimization

Design validation

Data transformation logic


Helped standardize mapping and transformation methods across multiple teams (CND, FUSE, IFP, CPNG, ELT).

Contributed reusable scripts and automation patterns that strengthened overall team efficiency.


Business Benefit & ROI

AI automation resulted in:

80–90% reduction in manual analysis effort

Faster delivery cycles across migration, API integration, and data cleanup

Near-zero rework, minimizing CF tickets and production defects

Scalable, repeatable solutions for future programs


Business stakeholders appreciated the speed, accuracy, and clarity of AI-enabled deliverables.

⭐ Final Summary (Upload this as last paragraph)

These initiatives demonstrate my commitment to innovation, continuous improvement, and leveraging AI to enhance delivery speed, accuracy, and cost efficiency. I actively look for opportunities to apply Copilot and Gemini in everyday development, API integration, troubleshooting, and migration activities. My contributions have strengthened our automation capabilities, improved partner confidence, and supported our long-term transformation goals in 1PSC.

Great! Based on your explanation and the screenshot, here's the Copilot prompt you can use to achieve the new structure:

✅ Copilot Prompt for Generating 4 Panels per PDU (with 1 Breaker Each)

> I have two CSV files:

1. PDU Sheet – This file contains a list of PDUs with their names and locations.

Relevant columns: Name (PDU name), Location (CLLI or site info).



2. Existing Panel Sheet – This has currently 1 local power panel per PDU (e.g., PDU A11 → LDO A11) with some fixed structure.



Now I want to restructure it:

🔁 For each PDU, generate 4 unique power panels, named like:

LDO A11-1, LDO A11-2, LDO A11-3, LDO A11-4

Follow the same logic for all PDUs from the first file.


⚙ Inside each new panel, I want to generate 1 breaker only.

✅ Maintain the following values from the original panel file:

Operation: ADD

Object: POWER PANEL LOCAL

Make, Model, Phase, Voltage, etc.: Same as existing panel template


🔁 Repeat this for all PDUs from the PDU CSV file.
📌 The output CSV should have 4x rows for each PDU, each with one panel and its respective values.

⚠ If needed, copy all other default or static values from the template in the existing panel sheet (e.g., Three Phase W, 1200, etc.).

Let me know if you’d also like a Python or Power Query version of this transformation.

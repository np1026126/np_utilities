Comment for the Bug:

> As part of the migration, the data was pulled directly from IFP. Even though the cabinet name is present in the comments section, the status for those breakers was marked as Open in IFP, so I’ve retained it as Open here as well.

I have cross-verified with IFP, and the asset details are matching correctly. For now, I’m maintaining the same data as received from IFP. Once the correct cabinet mapping is completed, the corresponding breakers will automatically move to a Closed state — which is already happening for other mapped entries.

Essentially, the data in our system reflects the IFP source data as-is.

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more formal and concise, like how you’d write in Jira comments or bug tracker notes?

âœ… IFP Migration Update â€“ 24th July 2025

Users started with validation of AC flow structures. As UPS values were not present in CPNG, they provided a one-line diagram with KW/KVA ratings for each UPS.

Based on the shared details, we created the UPS, UPS Bank, Load Devices, Floor PDU, and RPP entries to simulate the expected power chain in DCTrack.

Initially, we treated RPP as a Floor PDU, with a panel inside and fed from the Floor PDU, as per the existing IFP structure. Corresponding scripts were created for this setup.

However, after reviewing the one-line diagram during today's session, users were not satisfied with the visual representation (RPP inside a floor PDU).

With Sunbirdâ€™s support, we proposed a revised solution:
âž¤ Instead of a single RPP with two panels, we will create two RPPs, each holding one panel.
âž¤ This approach better matches user expectations and has been approved by the users for Windsor.

Required script changes have been acknowledged, particularly for the Floor PDU and panel creation logic.

ðŸ”§ Template & System Limitations Raised

These limitations were acknowledged in the call and are to be submitted as tickets to Sunbird:

1. RPP and PDU Room Mapping:
âž¤ The upload template doesn't support RPPs being placed in a different room than PDUs.
âž¤ Manual update in the DCTrack UI is required.
âž¤ Requesting template enhancement to support separate room assignments during upload.


2. Bulk Edit Room Assignment:
âž¤ No current capability to bulk edit room/location post-upload.
âž¤ This is needed for efficient mass updates when correcting or aligning room names.


3. Missing KW/KVA Inputs at PDU Level:
âž¤ Real-time KW/KVA readings (phase-wise) at PDU level are not captured.
âž¤ Users highlighted this is key for PDU utilization.
âž¤ Until resolved, these may be handled temporarily via custom fields.

ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes & Action Items

UPS values are still missing for many locations in CPNG.
âž¤ Users must provide this data to enable AC flow modeling.

In some locations, PDU entries are missing entirely.
âž¤ This also needs to be provided to proceed with full AC power mapping.

The above inputs are mandatory for implementing AC flows across all sites.

As agreed in todayâ€™s call, we will:

Update the AC flow structure for Windsor using the revised RPP logic.

Modify the scripts accordingly to reflect the new approach.

Share the updated Windsor data with users by Monday morning (July 28th, 2025).

Prepare for the next review call already scheduled for Monday morning, where users will validate the Windsor data output.

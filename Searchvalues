Here’s the updated migration update content including the new point about PLE and version 6.2 deployment checks:


---

Migration Update – Key Issues Identified

1. Data Saving & Field Passing Issues

RPP Panel Names: Missing RPP panel names are preventing the anticipated load screen from displaying correctly.

Field Mapping & Saving: Some fields are not being saved properly during updates; values are not persisting after page reloads because they seem to be cached instead of retrieved fresh.

Mirror Side Updates: In mirror scenarios, total load updates are partially failing—mirror values need to reflect both primary and redundant paths accurately.



---

2. Calculation Discrepancies

HVAC & Generator Calculations: Inaccurate values are appearing for both HVAC and generator anticipated loads, requiring correction in the backend calculation logic.

Dual Power Sources (AC & DC): When both AC and DC power exist for a single location, DC plant anticipated loads are not loading correctly, causing incomplete calculations.



---

3. Work Summary Display Issues

Incorrect Sections on Plant Selection: When selecting a DC plant, the work summary still displays UPS, PDU, and RPP sections instead of focusing on rectifiers, batteries, and plant-specific loads.

Anticipated Load Gaps: For DC plant selections, anticipated loads for plants are missing entirely, affecting load forecasting.



---

4. Deployment & Version Control

PLE Push Gaps: Some MRs and code changes are not being pushed properly into version 6.2 during the PLE deployment. The team needs to ensure all relevant changes are included in the 6.2 release before proceeding further.



---

Proposed Next Steps

1. Fix Field Mapping & Mirroring: Ensure proper field persistence and synchronize mirror updates for total load calculations.


2. Refactor Calculation Logic: Update HVAC, generator, and DC plant logic to handle dual power sources correctly.


3. UI Adjustments: Modify work summary components to dynamically render sections based on AC/DC context.


4. Version Check: Verify all pending MRs are merged into 6.2 before final PLE rollout.


5. Validation & Testing: Perform site-level validations post-fix to ensure data integrity across all modules.

If you want, I can prepare a visual flow diagram to show:

Where issues originate

Which systems are affected (DC Track, UI, calculations, deployments)

The dependencies for fixes


This will make it easier for both IT and business users to understand the scope quickly.

Do you want me to create that diagram? It will be in a simple format you can directly use in your migration report.

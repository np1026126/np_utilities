Subject: Summary of Migration Fallout Call – [Date]

Dear Team,

This is to summarize the key points discussed in today’s call regarding the migration fallouts across UPS, HVAC, AC assets, and Rocklin site data corrections. Please find the details and action items below.


---

1. UPS Asset Fallouts

Category 1: Missing room names for some assets – Users need to provide correct room names.

Category 2: Room names provided not matching with source sheet names – Users must align with source sheet.

Category 3: Incorrect room names vs. source names leading to mapping issues – Needs correction from users.


Action: Users to update correct room names for all affected UPS assets.


---

2. HVAC Assets

TAP Sites:

Users requested to refer to migrated original sheets (not regenerated sheets) as the original sheets have correct updated values for TAP sites.


SAP Sites:

Fallouts identified due to discrepancies between golden source sheet names and ELS location names (e.g., UPS/Battery vs. UPS Battery).

These need correction in ELS for consistency.



Action:

IT Team to correct naming mismatches in ELS.

Users to update sensible capacity in regenerated sheets where missing.

Got it 👍 Since you can’t download, I’ll print the full flow content here (structured like a PPT / Doc so you can copy-paste it directly into Git or convert into PPT).

Slide 1: Anticipated Load Calculation Flow

Flow Overview (Bottom-Up Calculation):

RPP Panel Level

User adds equipment → anticipated load = equipment watts ÷ 1000 (kW)

New anticipated load = consumed value (existing) + anticipated load (new PSE)


RPP Level

Sum of all connected RPP panel anticipated loads

Populate → new anticipated load, old anticipated load, and consumed values


PDU Level

Sum of all connected RPPs’ anticipated loads


UPS Bank Level

Sum of all connected PDUs’ anticipated loads

Calculations are maintained here since PDUs connect only to UPS banks (not directly to UPS)

Slide 2: Legends & Triggers

When Calculations Trigger:

Preview Mode (Before Save):

Delta calculations are performed but not committed.

User sees anticipated load preview values.


Save Mode (On Commit):

New anticipated load + existing values committed to DB.

Old records are deleted → new values persisted.



Tables & Columns (Cyrus DB Example):

anticipated_load_rpp_panel

Columns: job_id, plant_id, plant_name, anticipated_load, load_percentage, status


anticipated_load_rpp

Aggregate values from panels


anticipated_load_pdu

Aggregate values from RPPs


anticipated_load_ups_bank

Aggregate values from PDUs

Slide 3: Mirror Path Example (Redundancy)

Mirroring Logic:

For every Panel / RPP / UPS, there is a redundant “mirror” (A/B).

Users see only “A-side” assets (e.g., RPP-A1).

Backend automatically duplicates updates to mirror side (e.g., RPP-B1).

Example:

User assigns 5 kW to Panel A1.

System mirrors update → Panel B1 updated automatically.

UI always hides “B” side; only “A” shown.

👉 You can copy-paste this directly into Word, Google Docs, or PPT and then add arrows/flowchart shapes to make it visual.

Do you want me to also generate an ASCII-art style flowchart diagram (with arrows and boxes) so even without PPT shapes it looks like a flow diagram?

Got it. You need a formula in Excel that combines the 8-digit short name (Column A) with either:

New Room Name (Column I) when it’s present

Room Name (Column G) only when Column I is empty


Here’s the formula you can use:

=IF(I2<>"", A2 & " > " & I2, A2 & " > " & G2)

Explanation:

1. IF(I2<>"", ...) → Checks if Column I (New Room Name) is not empty.


2. A2 & " > " & I2 → If New Room Name exists, use it with Column A.


3. A2 & " > " & G2 → If New Room Name is empty, fallback to Room Name (Column G).



Steps:

1. Put this formula in the new column where you want the combined value.


2. Drag it down to apply for all rows.


3. This ensures the correct room name is picked automatically.

If you want, I can also give you a Google Sheets version that works the same way. Do you want me to give you that formula too?

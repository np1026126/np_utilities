Here’s a well-articulated and professional version for the second goal (Effectiveness) based on your input:

Description:

Level of Communication:

Maintained strong and effective communication across peers, team leads, and partner teams by proactively providing clarity and support:

Provided continuous guidance to Manasa, especially in understanding the Prairiega stories, ensuring she was confident in handling her assigned tasks.

Closely supported Subiksha by walking her through the stories assigned to her, identifying the required code changes, and helping her meet deadlines by breaking down the logic and flows.

Collaborated actively with PSC partner teams, where I clearly explained critical flows related to ELL, real-time, and UNO stories, along with migration components, enabling them to execute their tasks independently and efficiently.

My communication approach has always been structured, hands-on, and focused on helping others understand not just what to do, but also why it needs to be done a certain way.


This has resulted in positive feedback from peers, better cross-functional collaboration, and successful story delivery even under tight timelines. I strive to keep my communication clear, actionable, and well-received by both internal team members and external stakeholders.

Here’s the exact prompt you can use in Copilot to generate the Local Panel Breakers sheet for all PDUs and RPPs across locations:

✅ Copilot Prompt:

> Task: Generate a Local Panel Breakers Sheet using the given Floor PDU and RPP mapping sheet.

For each PDU and associated Local Panel (e.g., Load A1, Load B1...), create 4 breaker entries in the final output.

Use the following rules to populate the columns:

Column Name                      | Value / Rule
--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------
Operation                       | ADD
Object                          | If "Sub-Panel floor PDU" (RPP) is present → BREAKER TO PANEL
                                | Else → BREAKER TO OTHER
Panel Type                      | Local
Floor PDU                       | Use PDU name (from PDU-RPP mapping sheet)
Panel                           | Local panel name (e.g., LOAD-A1, LOAD-D1), based on PDU
Make                            | Generic
Model                           | Generic floor PDU
Location                        | Location of the PDU (from PDU-RPP mapping sheet)
Starting Pole No               | Repeat 4 records per PDU: 1, 7, 2, 8
No of Poles                     | 3 (for all rows)
Rated Amps                      | 600
Measured Amps                   | -1
Sub-Panel Location              | Location of RPP (from RPP name in mapping sheet)
Sub-Panel floor PDU             | Name of the RPP connected to this breaker
Breaker State                   | Open

Important Rules:

For each Local Panel (Load A1, Load D1, etc.), generate 4 breaker entries.

Pull PDU and RPP mapping from the sheet named "floor_pdu_with_missing_pdus" or similar.

For each PDU, map its associated RPPs and their locations for the sub-panel fields.

Multiple RPPs can be mapped to the same PDU. Repeat the 4-breaker block for each RPP if needed.


Final Output: Create an Excel or CSV file named local_panel_breakers_generated.csv with the above columns in order and one row per breaker entry.

Perfect — this is exactly a prompt-engineering use case 👍
Below is a ready-to-copy Google Gemini prompt you should use after uploading the CSV.

This prompt is written so that Gemini:

understands this is for Slack / management update

aggregates the data cleanly

produces counts + segregation

formats output in a presentable, copy-paste-friendly way

✅ Google Gemini Prompt (Use This Exactly)

> I am uploading a CSV file that contains PSC-related data.

Please analyze the CSV and present the data in a clean, management-ready summary format suitable for posting directly in Slack.

Requirements:

1. First, provide a high-level summary with the following metrics:

Total PSCs

Completed PSCs

In-Progress PSCs

Pending / Not Started PSCs (if applicable)



2. Next, for the 52 PSCs, provide a segregation by geography, clearly grouped as:

Area

Market

Sub-Market



3. For each Area → Market → Sub-Market combination, provide:

Number of PSCs

Breakdown by status (Completed / In-Progress / Pending)



4. Present the output in two sections:

Section 1: Executive summary (bullet points or compact table)

Section 2: Area / Market / Sub-Market breakdown in a structured table



5. Ensure:

No raw data dumps

Clear labels and counts

Clean formatting that can be pasted directly into Slack or PPT




If any required fields (Area / Market / Sub-Market / Status) are missing or inconsistent in the CSV, clearly call that out and proceed with the available data.

⭐ Pro Tip (From Experience)

If Gemini gives a table-heavy response, just follow up with:

> “Please rewrite the above in Slack-friendly bullet format.”



It works extremely well.

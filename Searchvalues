Perfect — you've shared two helpful screenshots:

📄 First image: Your new task plan content (to be migrated)

📊 Second image: A sample Excel format with structured columns (Seq #, Appl, Action, Object, Descriptor, Start Date, End Date, Comments)


Now, here's your exact prompt to use in Ask Copilot so that it will:

Take your provided task list as input

Use the sample headings and structure

Start dates from 15th August 2025

Populate durations and auto-fill dates

Provide a final downloadable Excel file

✅ Prompt for Ask Copilot: Excel Task Plan Generation

> I am providing a task plan list (copied as plain text or CSV) and a sample Excel format (which includes column headers and layout).

📌 Task Plan Input:

The list I’m providing should be treated as the task steps for a migration. These are pre-migration activities to be performed in the PLE environment.

📋 Use the following column headers from the sample format:

Seq #

Appl

Action

Object

Descriptor

Start Date

End Date

Comments from Activity


🗓️ Scheduling Logic:

Assume that the plan starts on 15th August 2025

Group the tasks as below:

Pre-Migration Tasks (PLE) → Aug 15, 2025 (all to be completed in 1 day)

Migration Phase → Aug 16–20 (5 days)

User Validation → Aug 21–28 (1 week)

Fallout Fixing → Aug 29–30 (2 days)

E2E Testing → Aug 31–Sep 1 (2 days)

Post-Migration in Production → Repeat same tasks starting Sep 2, 2025 onward (follow same structure)



✉️ Additional Notes:

Add entries like “Create AOS ticket”, “Turn OFF scheduler” under Action: "Create"

For Object and Descriptor columns, fill based on the task content

If not specified, leave "Comments from Activity" column empty


🧾 Output Requirement:

Final output should be a downloadable Excel file (.xlsx) with all columns populated and dates calculated from Aug 15, 2025

The full plan should include both PLE phase and Production phase

Once you give this prompt along with your actual CSV (or copy-paste task list), Copilot will be able to structure and generate the migration plan exactly like your sample.

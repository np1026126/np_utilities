Based on your requirement and the screenshot you shared, here is a step-by-step structured pre-migration and production plan tailored for your DC-TRAC migration work. Iâ€™ve also included the exact prompt you should ask in Google Gemini at the end.

ðŸ§  Prompt for Google Gemini

> Iâ€™m working on a DC-TRAC migration involving assets from IFP, CP&G, and FUSE. I need help drafting a structured pre-migration and production plan similar to the screenshot Iâ€™ve attached.

Steps involved:

First, upload Make & Model in PLE.

Then, asset data is imported (takes 3â€“4 days).

Fallouts are captured and logged in DB.

Fallouts are shared with users for correction (1 week).

QE and users validate the data.

Based on that, assets are then imported into Production after Make & Model is loaded.

Final fallout (if any) is resolved, users validate again.

Soft Launch is planned for end of September.


Please create a clear Gantt-style Excel plan or tabular breakdown with dates, owners, and comments like the format in my image. Assume first 54 sites data will come by July 25, rest by Aug 15.

Let me know if you'd like me to generate an Excel file for this plan so you can directly use it.

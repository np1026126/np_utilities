🚀 AI Prompt (Prompt-Engineer Style) — Asset Segregation Across 142 Excel Workbooks

Objective:
Consolidate asset data across 142 location-wise Excel workbooks. Each workbook contains 28 asset sheets. I need a Python script that merges each asset type across all locations into a single consolidated dataset.


---

Inputs:

A folder containing 142 Excel files (one per location).

Each file contains 28 sheets (sheet names represent asset types).

Each sheet contains tabular asset data for that specific location.



---

Requirements:
Generate a Python script (using pandas) that can:

1. Iterate through all 142 Excel workbooks in a given folder.


2. Identify the 28 asset sheet names (either dynamically or from a predefined list).


3. For each asset sheet:

Open the same sheet across all 142 files

Read and merge/append all rows

Handle missing sheets gracefully



4. Produce a consolidated output where:

Each asset becomes one combined dataset

Output can be 28 separate Excel files or one Excel file with 28 sheets



5. Ensure the script is:

Clean, readable, and production-ready

Fully commented

Easy to modify for new asset types or new locations





---

Output Format:

A Python script that:

Accepts an input folder path

Reads all files and merges asset data

Creates a final Excel output with consolidated data for all 28 assets




---

Constraints:

Ignore files or sheets that are missing or empty

Preserve original column names and data types

Ensure no duplicate headers appear in merged output

Maintain performance and avoid memory errors



---

Final Instruction to AI:
“Generate the complete Python script that performs all the above steps, including imports, directory scanning, workbook iteration, sheet merging, and exporting the final consolidated output. Add clear comments explaining every major step.”

If you want, I can also generate a slide version, a shorter prompt, or the actual Python code.

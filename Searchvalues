Perfect, now I fully understand what you want 👍
You already have a good reference output for Cancelled PSEs (your colleague’s categorization + insights + recommendations).
Now you want to do the same style of analysis for “In-Progress” PSEs using Excel log data and Google Gemini.
Below is a ready-to-use, well-structured Gemini prompt that will force Gemini to:
Read your Excel log data
Understand workflow/status text
Group In-Progress PSEs into meaningful categories
Provide counts, percentages
Provide actionable recommendations, just like the cancelled analysis
✅ FINAL GOOGLE GEMINI PROMPT (Copy–Paste as is)
I am uploading an Excel sheet that contains PSE job workflow logs for In-Progress PSEs only.
Each row represents a status change log for a PSE job.
The sheet contains at least these columns:
pse_job_id
log_time
log_entry or status_description (free-text workflow/status message)
These PSEs are not completed and are currently in In-Progress state.
Objective
Analyze the log history and categorize the In-Progress PSEs based on the latest workflow/status in a way similar to how cancelled PSEs were categorized.
Categorization Logic (Important)
For each pse_job_id:
Identify the latest log entry (max log_time)
Use the meaning of the latest status text to group the PSE into a logical category
Examples of expected categories (you may refine or rename if needed):
Sent Back to Requestor
Waiting for Planner Input
On Hold / Pending External Dependency
Waiting for Review / Approval
Reopened / Rework Required
Assignment Pending
Other In-Progress Workflow
Output Required
Provide the analysis in the following structure:
1. In-Progress PSE Categorization Summary
A table with:
Category
Number of PSEs
Percentage of total In-Progress PSEs
2. Category-wise Details
For each category:
List of pse_job_ids
Typical status/log patterns that led to this categorization
3. Key Insights
Highlight:
Top reasons why PSEs remain in progress
Workflow stages where PSEs get stuck the longest
Patterns such as repeated “Send Back” or “Reopen” cycles
4. Recommendations / Action Items
Provide practical, process-improvement recommendations, such as:
Intake form improvements
Validation or auto-checks
Ownership clarity
SLA monitoring suggestions
Training or documentation gaps
Additional Rules
Use only the latest status per PSE for categorization
Do not assume completion unless explicitly stated
Keep explanations concise and business-friendly
Present results similar in quality and clarity to a management review slide
If required, you may also suggest better category names based on observed patterns.
✅ OPTIONAL (If you want turnaround insight also)
Add this at the end if you want aging insight included:
Also highlight which categories have the highest average days in progress and call out high-risk PSEs.
🧠 Why this prompt will work
Forces Gemini to:
Use latest log only (critical)
Do semantic grouping (not just keywords)
Produce counts + insights + recommendations
Mirrors exactly what your colleague did for Cancelled PSEs
Output will be presentation-ready
📌 Pro Tip (Before Uploading Excel)
Ensure log_time is proper date/time
Ensure log_entry contains readable workflow text
Sorting does NOT matter (Gemini will compute max date)
If you want, next I can:
Help you align category names between Cancelled vs In-Progress (for PPT)
Create a single executive slide summary
Convert Gemini output into Excel formulas / pivot logic
Draft a Slack / email explanation to leadership
Just tell me 👍

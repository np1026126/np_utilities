Subject: Cabinet Creation Sync Issue Between CND and DCTrack

Description:
We are facing an issue with the synchronization between CND and DCTrack for cabinet creation. When a cabinet is created in CND, it is successfully sent via the API, and we can see the cabinet details being passed in the API payload. However, the cabinet is not getting created in DCTrack.

We have verified the API request and response, and the cabinet information is clearly visible in the payload. Despite this, the corresponding cabinet record does not appear in DCTrack.

Please investigate and let us know the root cause or if any additional configuration or mapping update is required on the DCTrack side.

Steps to Reproduce:

1. Create a cabinet in CND.


2. Verify that the cabinet data is sent to DCTrack via the API (refer to attached screenshot).


3. Observe that the cabinet is not visible in DCTrack.



Attachments:

Screenshot of API payload showing cabinet details being sent.


Expected Result:
The cabinet created in CND should automatically be created in DCTrack through the sync process.

Actual Result:
The cabinet record is not created in DCTrack even though the API call shows successful transmission.

Priority: High

Requested Action:
Please check and confirm if the sync process between CND and DCTrack is working as expected for cabinet creation, and help resolve the issue.

Would you like me to reword it slightly for Slack format (more concise, conversational) as well?

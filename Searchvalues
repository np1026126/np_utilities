Got it ✅
You now need a clear, logical, executive-style summary that explains:

• Why Steve’s sheet shows 79
• Why your query shows 60
• Why the correct number is 62
• What exactly was missed and why
• That you validated this bi-directionally

Below is a clean, professional summary you can paste in Slack, email, or a ticket update. It is factual, neutral, and defensible.

✅ Final Summary – PSE Count Reconciliation

> PSE Count Reconciliation Summary

We performed a detailed cross-verification between Steve’s Excel sheet (79 PSEs) and the query-based CSV output (60 PSEs). Below is the breakdown and final conclusion.

1️⃣ Comparison Outcome

Total PSEs in Steve’s sheet: 79

PSEs present in our sheet (query output): 60

PSEs missing in our sheet: 26


2️⃣ Analysis of Missing 26 PSEs

24 PSEs are older records (2024 / early-created) and were created before the Wireless migration, hence correctly excluded from our post-migration dataset.

2 PSEs were created in Dec-2025 and are in “Send Back to Requester” status.

These were created after migration

They were missed due to status filtering in our query logic.



3️⃣ Corrected & Final Count

Valid post-migration PSEs = 62

(60 existing + 2 “Send Back to Requester” PSEs)



4️⃣ Reverse Validation (Important Finding)

We also reverse-checked from our base dataset.

7 PSEs present in our sheet are missing from Steve’s sheet.

This indicates that the 79 count is incomplete and does not fully align with the system data.


✅ Final Conclusion

✅ The accurate post-migration PSE count is 62.

✅ The discrepancy was caused by:

Inclusion of pre-migration / legacy PSEs in Steve’s sheet

Exclusion of “Send Back to Requester” status in our query

Missing records in Steve’s dataset during reverse validation



We will update the query to include Send Back to Requester status going forward.

✅ If you want a short Slack-friendly version

> PSE reconciliation done:

Steve sheet: 79 PSEs

Our query: 60 PSEs


Of the 26 missing:

24 are pre-migration (2024 / older)

2 are Dec-2025 PSEs in Send Back to Requester (missed due to status filter)


✅ Correct post-migration count = 62

Reverse check also showed 7 PSEs missing in Steve’s sheet, so 79 isn’t complete either.

Query will be updated to include this status.

👍 You’re in a strong position here

You: ✅ validated both directions
✅ explained why counts differ
✅ identified a query gap (status filter)
✅ provided the correct number with evidence

The full comparison has been added directly into the 1-PAC Wireless PAC Adoption Metric sheet.

I have clearly marked:

PACs extra in Steve’s sheet

PACs missing from Steve’s sheet


These records are highlighted in yellow for easy identification.

The last two highlighted records are the Dec-2025 “Send Back to Requester” PACs that need to be added to our metric sheet to reach the accurate count.
Just say the word 👌

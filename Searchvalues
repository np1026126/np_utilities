Based on your detailed explanation and the three issues observed in the RPP breaker dataset, here's how you should phrase the prompt to Copilot to generate a corrected query or logic in MySQL 5.2:

✅ Prompt to Copilot:

> I have a MySQL 5.2 database and I'm generating the RPP Breaker output in a format compatible with DCTrack templates. There are three issues that need to be corrected in the query:

1. Starting Position Logic
If the # of Positions is 3 and the Starting Position No is 1, it means positions 1, 3, and 5 are occupied by that breaker. Therefore, no other record should reuse positions 3 or 5 for the same Panel and Floor PDU. This logic must be enforced to prevent overlaps.

2. Max Breakers Per Panel Rule
A single Panel (e.g., Panel1) can have only up to 42 entries. If a single Floor PDU has more than 42 breakers, they must be split across new panels as Panel1, Panel2, etc., ensuring each panel has at most 42 entries.

3. Generating Panel Name
Introduce a new column called Panel Name. The value for Panel Name must be derived from a manually curated mapping table called PowerPanelSPL, which maps Floor PDU + Location to a final Panel Name. If the mapping is missing, fallback to a default like 'Unknown_Panel'.

Please write a MySQL 5.2-compatible query (or logic in steps) that handles all 3 issues, assuming the data is coming from a staging table with the structure already shown in the Excel sheets.

Let me know if you want the actual SQL logic or procedure written out for this — I can help structure the steps for implementation as well.

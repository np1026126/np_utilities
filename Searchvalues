We would like to highlight our concern regarding the delivery status of the two defects assigned to your team last Friday. Despite providing ample time, we have observed that only one of the two defects has been pushed for further validation. The second defect still remains pending and has not been moved forward, which is disappointing at this critical stage.

With the production release scheduled for tomorrow, this kind of partial delivery puts the release at serious risk and is not acceptable. We had expected both items to be completed and handed off well within the agreed timeline to ensure smooth deployment.

We request your immediate attention to this matter. Going forward, we expect better ownership and timely delivery from your team to avoid such situations and maintain the integrity of the release schedule.

Please provide an urgent update on the pending item and a clear timeline for its resolution.

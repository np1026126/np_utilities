Here's a detailed script you can use during the call, along with a CoPilot prompt at the end for generating similar content.

âœ… Call Presentation Script: P&C Asset Migration Overview

Slide 1: Title Slide

> "Good [morning/afternoon], everyone. Today weâ€™re going to walk through the migration strategy for P&C assets into the 1PSC DCTrack system. The source systems involved are IFP, CP&G, and FUZE Compliance. Our goal is to consolidate all the asset data from these systems into a unified, structured, and DCTrack-compliant format."




---

Slide 2: Asset Sources and Types

> "Here you can see the asset types weâ€™re handling from each system.
From IFP, we have power panels, BDFBs, panel breakers, and plants.
From CP&G, we additionally handle rectifiers, RPPs, and plant bays.
FUZE contributes assets like generators, fuel tanks, HVACs, and batteries.



We have broken this out to ensure each asset has a defined path into the holistic template for DCTrack."


---

Slide 3: Reference Links and Mapping Resources

> "To support this effort, weâ€™ve created a structure of linked documentation:



Raw data dumps from source systems

Holistic templates used for import

Default values provided by business where system values were missing

Mapping between CP&G/FUZE and DCTrack template

A fix sheet to identify areas where business input is still required.


All links are organized in this table for quick reference."


---

Slide 4: Summary of Assets Across Systems

> "This summary shows:



Which assets exist in which system

Which ones weâ€™ve successfully tested in DCTrack

And the current count of records available for migration.


This helps prioritize where user input or clarification is still needed."


---

Slide 5: Key Challenges

> "Some challenges we encountered:



Room-level location data is often missing in CP&G and FUZE

Panel relationships are unclear in CP&G

Floor PDUs may be connected to UPS or another PDU, which is hard to trace

UPS banks and Load Devices are missing in CP&G and FUZE and must be manually filled by users

For some BDFB Panels, sources are not present in any of the three systems.


These gaps are reflected in the fix template sheet."


---

Slide 6: Next Steps

> "Now the key actions:



We need business users to review and finalize the holistic templates per site

Once approved, IT will upload them into 1PSC's non-prod environment (PLE)

Any fallouts or errors will be reported back and revalidated

Once verified, weâ€™ll move to production.


Itâ€™s important that for any defaulted or missing values, especially location/room data, business teams provide the final input."


---

Slide 7: Goal & Benefits

> "The overall goal is simple: create one source of truth.
Instead of relying on site visits, weâ€™re consolidating all data into one sheet per site.
This reduces time, increases accuracy, and makes validation easier.
It supports faster onboarding and better planning for MSC rollouts."

ðŸ¤– CoPilot Prompt to Get Similar Content:

Generate a complete presentation script to explain a P&C asset migration strategy from IFP, CP&G, and FUZE Compliance systems into DCTrack. 
Use the following structure:
- Explain asset types from each system
- Describe supporting documents (data dumps, holistic template, default mappings, fix sheets)
- Provide a summary of available assets and migration status
- Call out key challenges like missing room/location info or unclear source mappings
- List next steps for business review and finalization
- End with the business goal and benefits (time reduction, single source of truth)

Make the tone business-professional but clear for a non-technical audience.

Let me know if you'd like this content as a downloadable doc or formatted notes.

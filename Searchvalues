Here’s the exact Copilot prompt you can paste along with your SQL query to get a helpful debugging and fix suggestion 👇

🟩 Prompt for Copilot:

> You are an expert SQL developer.
I’m migrating data from one database to another, and I’m identifying BDFB-related assets based on the EduName field in the EDU table.
In this SQL query (pasted below), I’m filtering EduName using patterns like 'BDFB%', 'BDCBB%', 'PECB%', 'PDC%', 'MPDC%', and 'SPDC%'.
The issue is that for some assets, the EduName does not contain any of these keywords, and only a numeric value (like 301.04 or 102.02) is stored.
Because of that, my query is missing those rows and causing a mismatch in counts during migration.

Please help me modify or debug the query so that it can handle both cases —
1️⃣ Rows where EduName starts with these keywords, and
2️⃣ Rows where EduName has only a numeric value (i.e., no letters, just digits or dots).

Suggest the corrected SQL code and explain how the logic should work for this case.

Here’s the full query:

✅ Tip:
When you paste your actual SQL under that prompt, Copilot will detect patterns like LIKE 'BDFB%' and can propose an additional condition such as:

OR e.EduName NOT LIKE '%[A-Z]%'

or a PATINDEX rule to include number-only names.

Would you like me to tailor this Copilot prompt so it also mentions that you’re using SQL Server (T-SQL)? That helps Copilot give more precise syntax suggestions.

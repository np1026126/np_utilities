Subject: DCTrack Import Error ‚Äì Breaker2 Cabinet Data

Description:
We are facing an issue while performing a CSV import into DCTrack. The scenario is as follows:

We exported the Breaker2 cabinet data (connected to a panel) from DCTrack.

Without making any modifications to the exported file, we attempted to re-import the same CSV back into DCTrack.

During the import, the system threw an error message stating: ‚ÄúSystem error. Please contact Sunbird team for further assistance.‚Äù

Since no changes were made to the exported file, the expectation was that the import should have worked without errors.


Request:
Kindly investigate the cause of this system error and advise on the corrective steps required to successfully re-import the data. Please confirm if this is a system-side issue or if there are additional validations we need to check.

Asset Details:

Asset Type: Breaker2

Connected To: Breaker2 Cabinet (for the given panel)


Impact:
This issue is blocking us from making required updates via CSV import for breaker data.

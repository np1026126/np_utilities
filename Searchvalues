We reviewed the 54 SAP sites from the MSC perspective, and during this review, we found that only two sites — MSC Charlotte and MSC North Mecklenburg — share the same SAP short name. None of the other SAP sites have this issue.

Due to this shared short name, the query returned identical asset data for both sites. Since the records appeared as duplicates during upload, one of the entries (in this case, Charlotte) was removed under the assumption that it was redundant.

Now that we’ve identified the root cause — that both sites are pulling the same data due to the shared short name — we will correct the logic, re-run the queries, and ensure that both sites are distinctly captured in the next update.

Additionally, similar to the Rocklin case, we are also reviewing all other SAP sites to identify any overlaps in short names, especially where MSC and NEC sites might share a code. We will filter out any unintended data from NEC sites to ensure MSC sheets remain accurate and clean.

We want to emphasize that this issue is isolated to only these two sites, and the rest of the SAP site data is not affected. Please continue your work with confidence — we’ll ensure this correction is handled promptly.

Thanks again for pointing this out — it helped us uncover a critical edge case.

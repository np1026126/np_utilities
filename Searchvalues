✅ PDU Panel – Connection to RPP Tab

Description

The “No. of Poles” and “First Pole Number” fields define how the PDU panel is structured before mapping it to the RPP.
Since the PDU panel is being created only to support the PDU → RPP mapping (because RPP acts like a Floor PDU in the one-line diagram), the poles are being generated as dummy panels only for connectivity.

No. of Poles:

This represents the total number of pole positions available in that panel.

In real setups, the pole count is typically a multiple of 6 (e.g., 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, etc.).

For this site-survey, we default all PDU panels to 6 poles per panel, because each PDU has 4 sub-panels.

If the team can provide the actual pole count from site, that value can be entered instead.


First Pole Number:

This indicates the starting pole number for that specific panel.

Example:

If Panel-1 ends at pole 42, then Panel-2 starts at pole 43.


In our DCTrack import, all PDU panels were created as independent panels, so each one starts with 1 as the first pole number.

If the real site data indicates different starting positions, those can be entered.

✔️ PDU Panel – Connection to RPP Clarifications (Tabular Summary)

Field	What It Means	Guidance for Site Survey

No. of Poles	Total number of pole positions in the PDU panel	Default = 6 poles per panel. If actual pole count is known, please provide it.
First Pole Number	Starting pole position for that panel	Default = 1 for every panel. If actual start numbers differ (e.g., 43, 85), please capture them.
Why 4 Panels per PDU?	Each PDU requires 4 panel entries for mapping PDU → RPP	This is required to achieve correct one-line diagram connectivity in DCTrack.
If real panel details not available	—	Leave default values (6 poles, starting pole 1). Different color can be used to indicate missing data.

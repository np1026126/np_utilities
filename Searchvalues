Certainly! Here's a clear and context-rich prompt you can provide to Copilot Agent to regenerate the Microsoft SQL Server versions of your updated Postgres SQLs for both PDU breakers and BDFB breakers, referencing its prior memory:


---

âœ… Prompt for Copilot Agent:

> I had previously shared the Postgres SQL queries for PDU breakers and BDFB breakers, and you had already generated their corresponding Microsoft SQL Server versions.

Now, I have made some updates to the original Postgres SQLs for both assets. I am uploading the latest Postgres queries again.

Please generate the updated Microsoft SQL Server queries for both:

Updated PDU breakers query

Updated BDFB breakers query


Use the same format and logic that you followed earlier for converting them to Microsoft SQL Server. Refer to your memory of the previous converted versions to ensure consistency in style and syntax.

Input:

Updated Postgres SQL for PDU breakers:


-- paste updated Postgres query for PDU breakers here

Updated Postgres SQL for BDFB breakers:


-- paste updated Postgres query for BDFB breakers here

Output:

Updated Microsoft SQL Server versions of both queries

Let me know if you'd also like it to validate the syntax for MS SQL or break the output into stored procedure format.

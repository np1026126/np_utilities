Subject: Update on DC-Track and CNDB Cabinet Sync – Issue Still Persisting

Hi [Manager’s Name],

As per the recent update from Sunbird, the sync between DC-Track and CNDB was expected to work after removing the dummy Floor PDU and converting the load values from kW to W. I made the following changes and verified the results in DC-Track:

1. Removed the dummy Floor PDU entry that was part of the earlier configuration.


2. Requested CNDB to send anticipated load and current load in watts instead of kilowatts.



However, we are still facing the same issue — the cabinets are being created with the status “Planned” and showing the message “Origin: CMDB, Not Reconciled.”
Even after reconciling the record, the state remains the same.

I’ve attached screenshots for reference. Requesting Sunbird’s support team to review this behavior again, as this is still blocking our validation and demo activities.

Thanks and regards,

💬 Slack Message (to Howard / Sunbird Channel)

> Hi @Howard,

I made the changes as discussed — removed the dummy Floor PDU and ensured that anticipated and current load values are being sent in watts instead of kilowatts.

However, we’re still seeing the same issue: the cabinets are getting created with status “Planned” and showing “Origin: CMDB, Not Reconciled” in DC-Track. Even after reconciliation, the state remains unchanged.

Could you please help review this again? This is still a blocker for our validation and user demo.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a version of the email that directly includes Sunbird (Howard / Andy) in CC so it sounds more like a formal escalation instead of an internal update?

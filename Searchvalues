Description:

Operational Excellence and SLA Adherence:

Consistently drove operational discipline by adhering to SLA expectations across Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 engagements, while supporting platform stability, deployments, and production readiness:

Tier 1 (Deployment & Release Coordination):
Ensured smooth execution of Unity and production deployments by coordinating across teams, ensuring that all required processes were followed diligently.

Communicated changes effectively to the appropriate distribution lists.

Worked closely with deployment teams to ensure configurations were correctly implemented and that timelines were respected.


Tier 2 (Data Support & Monitoring):
Connected with Meghna on a regular basis to triage data-related issues and help resolve them promptly.

Actively supported data correction efforts and validations to ensure business continuity and minimal disruption to users.


Tier 3 (Bug Segregation & Prioritization):
Worked on classifying bugs and assigning ownership to the appropriate teams (TCS, VZI, Product).

Provided clear guidance on priority fixes to be included in upcoming production releases, enabling faster turnaround and reduced defect slippage.



Platform Security & Reliability:

Addressed BlackDuck vulnerability issues across certain services to ensure compliance and reduce security risks.

Collaborated with SRE teams to ensure proper tracking and improvements in SRE scoring:

For new APIs, supplied complete request/response payloads, usage scenarios, and design coverage to maintain expected reliability and observability standards.



Ownership in AOS Engagement:

Took ownership of AOS story triage, determining the right team (VZI, TCS, or Product) based on the type of issue.

Tracked delivery progress and ensured that fixes were implemented in a timely manner, without user impact during production rollouts.


These efforts reflect a strong commitment to stability, compliance, and cross-functional collaboration, contributing to high service quality and production excellence.

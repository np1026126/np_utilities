Here is a comprehensive and structured prompt you can copy and paste into GitHub Copilot (or any AI assistant tool you're using) to generate the rule book for every asset from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE to DCTrack, based on the SQL queries and DCTrack column mappings:

‚úÖ Prompt to Copilot (for Rule Book Generation):

> I have completed all the SQL queries for migrating assets from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE systems into DCTrack.
Now I want to generate a detailed rule book for each asset type in all 3 systems. This rule book should help users understand:

1. What each DCTrack column maps to from the source SQL query.


2. Which fields are mandatory in DCTrack (marked by a star * in the DCTrack column mapping sheet).


3. Which default values are being assigned for those mandatory fields if the source system does not provide a value.


4. Whether the default is a static value or calculated using a formula (if calculated, explain the formula used).


5. Which fields require user input or manual intervention, especially:

For fields like Location and Location Name, where the format must be:

Location = "Location Name > Room Name"

Location Name = "Room Name"


In systems like FUSE and CPNG, room-level details are not available, so users need to manually enter room names for those fields.




Please generate the rule book in the following format:

Group the rule book asset-wise, under each of the three systems.

For each asset, list out:

The DCTrack Column

Mapped Source Field (from SQL)

Is Mandatory (Yes/No)

Default Value (if used)

Formula Used (if applicable)

User Action Needed (Yes/No)

Notes (e.g., ‚ÄúUser must provide Room Name in Location‚Äù)



You will be provided:

The SQL queries used for each asset from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE systems

A DCTrack column mapping document that lists all DCTrack columns and shows which are mandatory (with *)


Based on this input, generate a clean and usable Rule Book document that can be shared with users, clearly indicating what values are filled automatically and what needs to be reviewed or manually updated by users.

üìå Additional Tips:

You can tell Copilot to output it in table format (Markdown or CSV).

If you're using VSCode, split it per asset into separate sections like:

# Generator - IFP

# Floor PDU - CPNG

# Plant Bay - FUSE

Let me know if you also want a template structure in Excel or Google Sheet to manually maintain this rule book ‚Äî I can generate that as well.

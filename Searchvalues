Here’s a clear, respectful Slack message you can post in your group channel to get that clarification on RPP and PDU level load calculations, referencing your earlier discussion with Andrij and Suresh:

Slack Message Draft:

Hi @Andrij Kulynych @Suresh Raman 👋

Just wanted to bring up one clarification regarding the RPP and PDU level calculations, which I had mentioned earlier in our chat but wanted to put it here in the open forum for alignment.

As per our current understanding —

The sum of the current load of all RPP panels connected under an RPP will give the current load of the RPP.

Similarly, the sum of the anticipated load of all RPP panels connected under that RPP will give the anticipated load of the RPP.

The total load at the RPP level will therefore be the sum of both current and anticipated loads of all connected panels.


Likewise, for the PDU level, the logic remains the same —

The sum of all RPPs’ current loads connected under a PDU will represent the current load of the PDU (which we are planning to source from CPNG as the actual/polled value).

The sum of all RPPs’ anticipated loads connected under the same PDU will give the anticipated load of the PDU.


Just wanted to reconfirm if this calculation flow aligns with your understanding as well. This was the clarification I intended to raise in the earlier call — not specific to Busway, but for RPP/PDU load derivation logic.

Thanks! 🙏
Naveen


Here’s a visually clear Slack message with a structured flow diagram using text symbols (so it’s easy to read inside Slack). It summarizes the logic in one glance and politely clarifies the misunderstanding from the previous busway discussion:

Slack Message Draft (with Visualization):

Hi @Andrij Kulynych @Suresh Raman 👋

Just wanted to bring up one clarification on the RPP and PDU load calculation logic, which I had intended to raise during our earlier call on Busway implementation — but it was unfortunately misunderstood as a Busway-specific question.

Here’s what I was trying to confirm 👇

Cabinet Level
  └─ (Sum of Reserve Power of Breakers) = Current Load of Panel
  └─ (Sum of Dry-Fit Values) = Anticipated Load of Panel

Panel Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of Cabinets) = Current Load of Panel
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of Cabinets) = Anticipated Load of Panel
  └─ (Current + Anticipated) = Total Load of Panel

RPP Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of Panels under RPP) = Current Load of RPP
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of Panels under RPP) = Anticipated Load of RPP
  └─ (Current + Anticipated) = Total Load of RPP

PDU Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of RPPs under PDU) = Current Load of PDU (to be sourced from CPNG actual load)
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of RPPs under PDU) = Anticipated Load of PDU

So essentially, at each hierarchy level (Cabinet → Panel → RPP → PDU),
we’re summing the current and anticipated loads from the immediate downstream level, and representing the total accordingly.

Could you please confirm if this approach aligns with your understanding?
If needed, I’m happy to quickly walk through this in a call to clarify visually with an example.

Thanks 🙏
Naveen

Would you like me to make a second version that also includes the UPS Bank hierarchy (showing PDU → UPS Bank → UPS Modules) so you can use the same style for your next-level discussions?

Would you like me to include a short diagram snippet text (like a one-line ASCII power chain example: UPS → PDU → RPP → Panel → Cabinet) at the end of the message for easier visualization when you post it?

Perfect — you're asking CoPilot to automatically compare the original CSV and the updated CSV and generate a clear change summary. Here's a CoPilot prompt tailored for that task:


---

✅ CoPilot Prompt – Compare Two CSVs and Summarize All Column-Level Changes


---

Prompt:

> I’m uploading two CSV files:

1. Original.csv – the file before cleanup


2. Updated.csv – the file after changes (generated by CoPilot)



✅ Task:

Please compare both files row by row and column by column. For every row where any cell value has changed, provide a concise change summary.

Output Format:

For every change:

Mention the row number (or unique ID if available)

Mention the column name

Show: Original Value ➝ Updated Value


Example:

Row 5:
- Floor PDU: RPP_A112 ➝ PDU-A11
- Location: Panel A ➝ RPP-A111-SECTION1

Row 8:
- Rating (A): 200 ➝ 400
- Phase: Two Phase ➝ Three Phase

✅ Additional Instructions:

Highlight only the changed cells (no need to list unchanged columns).

If possible, group by row for clarity.

If row IDs are missing, use the row index from the CSV.


This summary should help us document all changes made between the original and updated versions without manually reviewing each row.

If you want to do this locally (without CoPilot), I can also give you a Python or Excel formula-based script to compare and list changes automatically. Just let me know!

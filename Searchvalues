Update – Battery Holistic Template Enhancement

Hi Team,

We’ve identified a few additional fields that need to be included in the Battery holistic template. These fields are derived from the Macon model specifications, since the Macon model records in DC-Track production currently do not contain this information.

The following columns will be added to the template for data collection:

Target Run Time (Hours)

Capacity (AH)

Nominal Voltage

Number of Cells

Peukert Exponent

Capacity 1 Rate (Hours)

Capacity 1 (Amp-Hour)

Capacity 2 Rate (Hours)

Capacity 2 (Amp-Hour)


These values should be populated directly from the site-verified battery model details.
➡️ Note: It is not required to add a “voice” entry for the Macon model. The enhancement only involves adding the above data fields to complete the Macon model information for each battery record.

I’ll share the updated sample sheet reflecting these fields shortly.

Thanks,
Naveen

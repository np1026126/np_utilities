Got it 👍
You already have the Excel with full PSE job history, and now you want to ask Google Gemini (GME) to analyze it and produce the exact metrics:
Creation date of each PSE
Last status change date (latest log entry per PSE)
Days in progress from creation → last change
Days still in progress from last change → current date (31 Dec)
For 12 PSEs, all summarized cleanly
Below is the exact prompt you should paste into Google Gemini, along with how to structure the ask so Gemini gives you a correct, usable output.
✅ Recommended Google Gemini Prompt (Copy–Paste)
I am uploading an Excel sheet that contains PSE job history logs.
Each row represents a status change event for a PSE job.
The sheet contains at least the following columns:
pse_job_id
log_time (timestamp when the status changed)
status / log_entry / description (text showing the workflow step)
Objective: For each unique pse_job_id, calculate:
Creation Date – earliest log_time for that PSE
Last Updated Date – latest log_time for that PSE
Days from Creation to Last Update
Days In Progress Since Last Update, assuming current date = 31-Dec-2024
Current Status – status corresponding to the latest log_time
These PSEs are not completed and are still In Progress.
Output format required:
One row per pse_job_id
A clean summary table with these columns:
PSE Job ID
Created Date
Last Updated Date
Days Between Creation and Last Update
Days In Progress (Last Update → 31-Dec-2024)
Latest Status
Also:
Ignore duplicate status entries on the same day
Use date difference in calendar days
Clearly explain the logic used to derive the dates
✅ Optional (If you want Buckets like your earlier report)
Add this extra line at the end of the prompt:
Additionally, bucket the Days In Progress into:
< 5 days
5–10 days
10–20 days
> 20 days
✅ If You Want Gemini to Generate Excel Formulas Too
Add this line:
Also provide Excel formulas that can be used to calculate:
Earliest date per PSE
Latest date per PSE
Date difference metrics
🧠 Why this prompt works
Clearly defines what each row means
Explicitly explains what “last day” means (latest log entry)
Fixes the current date (31-Dec) so Gemini doesn’t assume today
Forces one-row-per-PSE aggregation
Prevents Gemini from just summarizing text instead of calculating
📌 Pro Tip (Very Important)
Before uploading:
Ensure log_time is a real date column, not text
Ensure pse_job_id has no blanks
Sort order does not matter (Gemini will handle min/max)
If you want, next I can:
Give you pure Excel formulas (no Gemini needed)
Or help you create a pivot + helper columns
Or write a SQL query to compute this directly from DB
Just tell me 👍

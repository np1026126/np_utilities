Subject: Clarification on Data Submission and Panel Breakers

Hi Andrij,

Sorry for the miss — if it was from our end, we didn’t see that part. The last update I received on July 29th (forwarded from Steve) mentioned that Rocklin was completed as the 3rd site and you were working on the 4th site. After that, I didn’t get any further communication, so we assumed you were still working on the complete dataset.

If I had received the note that the full data was submitted on the 8th, I would have gone through it right away. I believe I was not copied on the email when the completed list was shared, which is why I wasn’t aware until now. Once I got to know, I immediately reviewed it.

On the load devices — we can take care of creating those on our side, that’s not an issue. The only point where we need clarification/help is with the panel breakers. Could you please confirm whether you’ll be able to provide the panel breaker details, or if we should be sourcing them directly from IFP?

Thanks again for your support, and apologies for the confusion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

👉 Do you also want me to tighten this into a shorter Slack-friendly version (something quick and polite) that you can paste directly in your project channel?

Hi Peter,

Yes, initially we had considered 1200 amps, but I’ve corrected it to 1800 amps.

For PDUs with 3 RPPs connected, I’ve updated the panel size to 1800 amps accordingly — since each RPP has 1200 amps worth of breakers, the total breaker load connected to the panel comes up to 3600 amps.

Let me know if you need any further clarification.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

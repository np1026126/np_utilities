Thank you for the clarification! Here's the exact prompt you can copy and paste into Copilot or any AI assistant that works with your Excel or CSV files:

✅ Copilot Prompt (Final Version):

> I have two Excel sheets:

First sheet: "Rooms in Site List from IFP"
Columns: SITE ID, SITE NAME, CLLI, ROOM NAME, and Location format Expected in Holistic template.

Second sheet: "Production Migration 1PSC Production VZW Site Sheet"
Columns: SITE ID, Site Name, CLLI, Room Name, Add, Delete, New Site Name(Edit), and others.


I want you to compare these two sheets based on the combination of CLLI and Room Name. Based on the comparison, modify the first sheet by doing the following:

1. If a room exists in the second sheet but not in the first, append it to the first sheet.


2. Add three new columns in the first sheet:

New Room Name → the room name from the second sheet (if newly added or renamed)

Status → values should be:

Add if it's a new room

Update if the room name is changed for the same CLLI

Delete if it exists in the first but not in the second

Unchanged if it exists in both without change


CLLI > Room Name → create this by joining CLLI and Room Name using > as separator.



3. Keep all original columns in the first sheet as-is.


4. Generate the final result as a downloadable Excel file.

Subject: Clarification on HVAC Data Source for Migration

Hi Team,

I want to clarify an important point regarding the HVAC data for migration. During our earlier discussions with Pete and the other stakeholders, it was agreed that:

The HVAC zones would be fully regenerated with the new room names.

The sensible cooling capacity details would be updated in the regenerated sheet, not in the old FUSE-based sheet.


However, the recent checks seem to be referring to the old FUSE data, whereas the expectation was always to use the regenerated HVAC sheet—the same approach we followed for UPS, PDU, and PDU panels.

This means the verification and migration should only be based on the regenerated HVAC data where the cooling capacity details are correctly captured for all zones as per the new setup.

Please ensure we align on this so that there is no confusion between the old data source and the regenerated one.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

Subject: Update on HVAC Data for Migration

Hi Team,

I wanted to clarify the current status of the HVAC data being used for the migration:

Initially, the HVAC data was taken from FUSE. However, during validation, users, including Andrei, confirmed that this data was not accurate and should not be used for the final migration.

It was agreed by Pete and others that the zones must be regenerated with updated room names, and the cooling capacity (Sensible Cooling) would be populated based on this regenerated data.

While some sites have already been updated with the regenerated HVAC data, others are still pending and currently show the older FUSE data, which is leading to confusion when reviewing reports.


Next Steps:

We will ensure that only the regenerated HVAC data with correct room names is used for all SAPs/SAP types.

The missing sites will be updated so that the migration reflects accurate cooling capacity values as intended.


This will avoid inconsistencies in the analysis and ensure everyone is referring to the correct dataset moving forward.

Thanks & Regards,
Your Name

Got it, Naveen 👍 — you’re clarifying that these battery-specific fields are not from the Macon model but should be added under the battery make and model details, so that any new make/model coming in will have these parameters predefined.

Here’s a polished and professional message you can post in the Slack channel to convey that clearly 👇

Update – Battery Template Enhancement

Hi Team,

We’ve identified a few additional parameters that need to be captured under the Battery Make & Model section.
These fields are not part of the Macon model; rather, they define key specifications for each battery make and model.
Whenever a new battery make/model is introduced, these fields should also be added for it.

To maintain consistency and for easier reference, we are including these same columns in the Battery section of the holistic template as well.

New fields to be included:

Target Run Time (Hours)

Capacity (AH)

Nominal Voltage

Number of Cells

Peukert Exponent

Capacity 1 Rate (Hours)

Capacity 1 (Amp-Hour)

Capacity 2 Rate (Hours)

Capacity 2 (Amp-Hour)


I’ll share the sample sheet link shortly with these fields pre-added. Please use that reference to update and correct the battery data for your respective site(s).
The sample will include one location’s data to help you understand how to populate the values correctly.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a shorter, 3-line Slack post version of this (to go with the link when you share the sample sheet)?

Here is the revised, complete, professional mail intro, now including the missing-asset part (Utility Feed, Transformer, ATS/Main Switchboard, Load Devices for Switchboard), exactly as you explained:

📧 Mail Draft – Final Intro Section (with all points you requested)

Hi Jessica,

As discussed, I’ve prepared the updated templates and reference sheets required before beginning the Wall TWP and Branchburg site surveys. Before sending the detailed AC and DC asset clarifications, here is a summary of the updates and additional inputs:


---

1. Battery Template Enhancements

I have added additional Make/Model–specific fields at the end of the Battery sheet.
Whenever a new Make and Model is provided (instead of using the generic model), these fields help maintain accurate Make/Model definitions inside DC-Track.
If the vendor provides a new battery model during the site survey, these additional fields should be filled in.


---

2. Updated Reference Template (DC-Track Imported Data)

Instead of using the older holistic sample template, I have extracted the actual data that was successfully imported into DC-Track.
This file can now be used as the base template for the vendor.
They can directly edit/extend the values on top of this sheet, ensuring that the:

Column structure,

Naming conventions, and

Accepted formats
match exactly with DC-Track requirements.

3. Upstream Assets Missing from Source Systems (Important Note)

For several upstream assets—

Utility Feeds,

Transformers,

ATS / Main Electrical Switchboards, and

Load Devices connecting Switchboard → downstream panels


—no data is available in any of the three source systems (CPNG, IFP, or FUSE).
These were the main reasons these assets were not included in the earlier templates.

However, I noticed that many of these upstream components are actually physically present in MS Elixir.
Since these assets are important for completing the full AC/DC power-chain mapping in DC-Track, I am now including:

Sample templates for Utility Feed, Transformer, ATS/Main Switchboard, and Load Devices (Switchboard)

These will be attached at the bottom of the DC-Track reference sheet


If these upstream assets exist at the Wall TWP or Branchburg sites,
please include them as part of the site survey, using the sample templates I am providing.

This will help ensure the power-chain formation remains complete from Utility/Generator → Switchboard → UPS/Plant → Panels → Devices.

4. Additional Attachments

Along with this mail, I am sharing:

Clarification Sheet (answers to all questions raised on asset fields)

AC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis

DC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis

DC-Track imported reference template, including

UPS, UPS Bank, PDU, RPP, Plant assets

Plus new templates for Utility Feed, Transformer, ATS/Switchboard, and Load Devices for Switchboard

Plus Battery section with added columns



I will now provide the detailed AC and DC asset clarifications in the next section of the mail thread.

Thanks,
Naveen

Absolutely — here is the same consolidated clarification, rewritten in the same professional, structured, tabular format you liked earlier.
This is ready to copy-paste into your email or Slack message.

✅ Consolidated Clarification (With Tabular Format)


---

1. OPERATION COLUMN (ADD / EDIT / DELETE)

Description:
The Operation column indicates what action DC-Track should perform for each row during import.
Only the three valid values below are accepted. Any other value will make the row ignored.

Operation Value	Meaning	When It Is Used

ADD	Add a new asset record in DC-Track	When the asset does not exist in DC-Track
EDIT	Update an existing record	When the asset already exists and needs correction
DELETE	Remove the existing record from DC-Track	When the asset needs to be deleted



---

2. STATUS COLUMN (PLANNED / INSTALLED / ARCHIVED)

Description:
The Status column denotes the real-world installation state of the asset at the site.

Status Value	Meaning / Interpretation

PLANNED	Asset is expected to be installed; not yet physically placed
INSTALLED	Asset is already placed physically at the site
ARCHIVED	Asset was present earlier but is removed/retired


Only these three values are expected in the Status field.


---

3. BDFB CLARIFICATIONS


---

A) NUMBER OF LOADS

Description:
Refers to the number of downstream devices/panels fed by the BDFB.
This field is optional and can remain blank if unknown.

Field	Site Survey Input	Correct Expectation

Number of Loads	Blank / Unknown	✔ Optional — can be left blank if the value is not known. <br>✔ Represents number of downstream loads/panels.



---

B) BDFB EQUIPMENT SERVED

Description:
This is a dropdown field in DC-Track. Only predefined values are permitted.

Field	Allowed Values (Dropdown)	Guidance

BDFB Equipment Served	DSL, FiOS, IOF/ROADM, Inside Hut, Data/Router, Old Toll, New Toll, Colocation	✔ Choose the correct one if known. <br>✔ If unsure, a general/default value like DSL can be used.



---

✔ FINAL ONE-BLOCK SUMMARY (Easy to Share)

Topic	Correct Guidance

Operation	ADD → create new asset; EDIT → update existing; DELETE → remove existing. Any other value → ignored.
Status	PLANNED → not installed; INSTALLED → physically present; ARCHIVED → retired.
BDFB – Number of Loads	Optional; leave blank if unknown. Represents number of downstream loads/panels.
BDFB – Equipment Served	Select from dropdown: DSL / FiOS / IOF/ROADM / Inside Hut / Data/Router / Old Toll / New Toll / Colocation. If unsure → use DSL.

If you want, I can now also create a similar tabular clarification section for UPS, UPS Bank, PDU, PDU Panel, RPP, HVAC, so everything becomes a single polished document.

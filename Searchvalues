⭐ Effectiveness (Communication, Collaboration & Cross-Team Influence)

Demonstrated strong, clear, and consistent communication across multiple teams, stakeholders, and partner groups throughout the year. Actively collaborated with peers, vendor teams, product groups, and end-users to drive alignment, accelerate delivery, and resolve issues quickly.

Key Contributions & Effectiveness:

1. Cross-Team Collaboration Across C&D, ELS, FUSE, IFP, CPNG & Vendor Teams

Worked closely with the C&D team for multiple integrations such as C&D → ELS location sync, DC-Track ↔ C&D budget load updates, and DC-Track XML sync.

Collaborated with C&D engineers to troubleshoot, validate, and successfully complete the budget load update APIs and DC-Track sync flows.

Partnered with the FUSE team to gather table details needed for PSE creation and ensured smooth flow for PSE relations.

Coordinated extensively with IFP and CPNG SMEs to collect missing data, clarify schema logic, and validate unstructured datasets during the wireless migration.

Maintained strong alignment with Vendor Partners (TCS team) through regular sync-ups, clarifying story logic, reviewing acceptance criteria, and enabling them to deliver tasks efficiently.


2. Stakeholder & End-User Engagement (Wireless + Wireline)

Built excellent rapport with Wireless users, especially during the migration effort.

Provided hands-on support by creating sample locations, sharing extracted three-system data, and validating user corrections.

Frequently connected with users to clarify DC-Track behavior, explain power-chain formation, and guide them through asset dependencies.

Maintained direct communication with Wireline users as well, supporting production bug analysis and ensuring expectations were managed clearly.

Ensured high stakeholder satisfaction by promptly resolving doubts, providing clear explanations, and maintaining transparency.


3. Effective Communication with Product, DevOps & Platform Teams

Worked closely with Product teams during production bug cycles, providing detailed RCA, guiding them on priority items, and ensuring accurate problem resolution.

Coordinated with Platform/DevOps teams for production releases (CA deployments, threading, GC updates), ensuring smooth execution of deployments and timely fixes.

Maintained continuous communication with the Tier-2 and Tier-3 teams, helping them understand business logic, technical flows, and dependencies related to Wireless DC-Track transformations.


4. Leading Clear, Structured Discussions and RCA Communication

Explained complex stories, logic, and system flows in simple and structured terms to internal teams, vendors, and cross-functional groups.

Provided detailed RCA for production issues and guided teams on how changes should be applied without introducing regressions.

Ensured communication was professional, timely, and tailored to diverse audiences (developers, architects, product owners, and end-users).


5. Driving User Confidence & Smooth Migration Collaboration

During the wireless migration, maintained continuous collaboration with every required team — Wireless users, IFP, CPNG, FUSE, C&D, and vendor teams — ensuring dependencies were resolved quickly.

Guided users on validating extracted data, resolving mismatches, and understanding DC-Track’s power-chain model.

Built user confidence by handling fallout fixes, manually correcting data where needed, and ensuring high-quality import sheets.

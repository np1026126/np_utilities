Hi Andres,

Good Afternoon, and thank you for your follow-up.

As previously communicated, we had initially aimed to provide the remaining supplementary sheet for the SAP sites by the end of today. When the request came in, we mentioned that we would try to share it by today morning (US time). However, we encountered a few challenges that have delayed the completion.

Specifically, we faced multiple fallouts related to the RPP naming conventions, which impacted our ability to correctly identify and map the associated PDUs and related fields. Due to these inconsistencies, it has taken additional time to validate and finalize the data to ensure accuracy.

We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and truly appreciate your patience and understanding.

We are actively working to close the remaining 7 assets and are targeting to have the completed sheet ready by end of day today (our time), so that it will be available for your review tomorrow.

Additionally, you had mentioned that if we are able to provide the sheet by today, your team could proceed with the review and finalize it by the 13th. We would like to confirm if that timeline still holds, or if it might need to be extended by a day due to this slight delay from our end.

Please let us know. Thank you again for your continued support.

Best regards,
Naveen Prasad Natarajan

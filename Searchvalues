Slack Message Draft:

Hi [Userâ€™s Name] ðŸ‘‹

I was checking the details you shared earlier for the location [mention location name], where you had asked me to add the BDFB and the BDFB panels.

When I verified in CPMG, I noticed that the BDFB panel breakers are not present there.
Craig also confirmed that the values are not coming from CPMG because the BDFB panel breakers themselves are missing in the source.

Could you please check once and confirm whether these BDFB panels are maintained in any other source system or if we have to get the details manually for this location?

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a slightly formal email version of this too (in case you need to loop in the C&D migration team and Craig)?

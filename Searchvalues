⚙️ Clarification on Upstream Power Assets (Utility Feed, Transformer, Switchboard & Load Devices)

Hi Team,

From our side, as part of the data migration from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE, we were able to retrieve most of the DC and AC assets that are required for forming the power chain in DC Track.
However, during the extraction we noticed that certain upstream assets — specifically the Utility Feed, Transformers, ATS/Main Electrical Switchboards, and their connecting Load Devices — were not available in the source systems (CPNG/FUSE/IFP).

Because these upstream components were missing, we did not import those assets or their related Excel sheets (Utility Feed, Transformer, Switchboard, and Load Device templates) into DC Track.
To ensure the power-chain continuity and calculation flow still function properly, we started the import from:

DC Plant level for DC Flow

UPS level for AC Flow


These starting points allow the power flow to be accurately mapped even without the upstream utility and switchboard data.

At the same time, we did not import any Equipment assets, since equipment-level data was not available from the source systems.

If you would like to include those upstream elements (Utility Feed, Transformer, Switchboard, and Load Devices) for completeness, we can share sample template sheets that can be used for your reference. You can fill in those details, and we can include them in the next import cycle.

Please review and confirm if you’d like to proceed with those additional upstream components.

Thanks,
Naveen

Update: Site Survey Corrections & Power-Chain Details

Hi team,
We’ve reviewed the site-survey inputs and will share per-asset changes and guidance shortly. In particular, we’ll cover:

Load Devices: how to map UPS ↔ UPS Bank and UPS Bank ↔ PDU, and transformer/generator ↔ bus connections

DC Plant Panel and DC Plant Panel Breakers: required structure to feed BDFB/BDFB panels (Plant / Plant Panel : Plant Panel Breakers)

Sample sheets: updated templates to fill these items correctly


I’ll share the detailed change list and sample sheets in about 1 hour.
Please plan to connect with me then for a quick walk-through and Q&A.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to give you a short Slack version (3–4 lines) of this message, suitable for posting in your user migration channel with the sample sheets attached?

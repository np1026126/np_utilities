Perfect question 👍
You don’t need code here — you need a strong, unambiguous Gemini prompt so it does the comparison correctly and gives you a clean output you can trust.

Below is a ready-to-copy prompt you should use in Google Gemini after uploading both files (the Excel + CSV).

✅ Recommended Google Gemini Prompt (Copy–Paste)

> You are a data analyst.

I have uploaded two files:

1. Excel file – contains all PSC / PSE jobs created after migration (around 79 records).


2. CSV file – contains PSC job data fetched using a database query (around 59 records).



What I need you to do:

1. Treat “PSC Job Number” as the primary key in both files.


2. Compare the two files and identify PSC Job Numbers that exist in the Excel file but are missing in the CSV file.


3. For every missing PSC Job Number, extract the following details from the Excel file:

PSC Job Number

Status

Created Date

Created By

Base Location



4. Clearly state:

Total record count in Excel

Total record count in CSV

Count of missing PSC Job Numbers



5. Present the results in a clean tabular format.



Output format:

First section: Summary (counts and differences)

Second section: Table showing missing PSC Job Numbers with their status and details


Do not assume any data. Only use the uploaded files for comparison.

✅ If you want an even stricter / safer prompt (recommended)

Use this if you want zero hallucination:

> IMPORTANT:

Do not infer missing data.

Do not auto-correct job numbers.

Only report PSC Job Numbers that appear exactly in the Excel file and are completely absent in the CSV file.

✅ What Gemini should give you (Expected Output)

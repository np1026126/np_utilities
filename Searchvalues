Subject: Clarification on Missing BDFB Panel Breakers in CPNG

Hi [User’s Name],

I’m part of the 1PSC team working on the migration of assets from IFP, CPNG, and Fuze into DC-Track.
I need one clarification regarding the BDFB and BDFB Panel migration details.

For a few locations (like Adelphi and Albuquerque), we have BDFBs and their corresponding panels marked as “ADD” to be migrated into DC-Track.
However, when I verified in CPNG, I noticed that the BDFB panel breakers are not present there.
Craig also confirmed that these values are not coming from CPNG since the BDFB panel breaker data doesn’t exist in the source.

Got it — this reply needs to be firm, factual, and reference-backed, without sounding confrontational.
The key is to separate “why DCTrack works this way” from “why the current data won’t work”, and politely close the loop on the screenshot they shared.

Clarification on RPP Panel Naming and DCTrack Mirroring Requirement
Hi Andrji,
Thanks for sharing the screenshot and the context on why the panel names were provided with the RPP name embedded.
I want to clarify the behavior from a DCTrack implementation and system-rule perspective, so we are aligned on why the current naming will not support mirroring and redundancy as expected.
How DCTrack Handles Redundancy and Panel Mirroring
As per DCTrack design and the official Power Panel Mirroring documentation:
Only Floor PDUs can be configured as a redundant pair
In our migration model, RPPs are treated as Floor PDUs
Once two Floor PDUs (RPPA and RPPB) are set as a redundant pair, DCTrack allows the Local Power Panels inside them to be mirrored
For panel mirroring to work:
The Local Power Panels under both sides must have the exact same panel name
DCTrack uses the panel name as the matching key when performing mirroring
Any difference in the panel name (including prefixing with RPP name) will prevent mirroring
This is explicitly stated in the DCTrack documentation:
“Local Power Panels to be mirrored must have the same name.”
Why Unique Panel Names Per RPP Will Not Work
I understand the intent behind making panel names unique by adding the RPP name (for example, RPPA1A, RPPB1A) to indicate association.
However, in DCTrack:
Panel uniqueness is already maintained by hierarchy (Floor PDU → Panel), not by name alone
Mirroring logic does not rely on hierarchy, it relies strictly on panel name equality
As a result, having different names across RPPA and RPPB:
Breaks mirroring
Prevents synchronized updates between A and B sides
Defeats the redundancy behavior expected in DCPAC
This is why, even though the naming improves readability, it is not compatible with DCTrack mirroring mechanics.
Required Approach for NEC Migration
To enable proper redundancy and mirroring for NEC sites (consistent with MSC migration and ISP):
RPPs will be modeled as Floor PDUs
RPPA and RPPB will be configured as a redundant pair
Local Power Panels under both RPPA and RPPB must:
Have identical names (for example, Panel A, Panel B, or Panel 1)
Not embed the RPP name in the panel name
DCTrack will then automatically mirror:
Breakers
Assignments
Panel changes between A and B sides
Summary
The current NEC panel naming was likely provided with good intent for clarity
However, due to DCTrack system rules, this naming prevents mirroring
To support redundancy correctly, panel names must match exactly across RPPA and RPPB
We are aligning NEC migration with:
DCTrack implementation rules
Official DCTrack documentation
The same model successfully used for MSC sites
Please let us know if you’d like to review this together or if you prefer we share a concrete before/after example from MSC to demonstrate the behavior.
Thanks,
Naveen

In this Excel sheet, check the "First Pole Number" column. The pole count for each row is 42. The first pole number must start from 1 for the first entry in a group and then increment by 42 for each subsequent row. Fix rows where the first pole number resets to 1 after already being 43. Ensure it continues the sequence (1, 43, 85, etc.) based on previous row's pole count.

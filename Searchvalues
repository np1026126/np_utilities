Here you go, Naveen — three clean sections, each written in a professional, performance-review format, covering EVERY point you said, organized clearly, crisp, complete, and ready to paste.

SECTION 1 — AC Wireless Calculations, HVAC Logic & Utilization (Full Ownership)

I took complete ownership of the Wireless AC power-chain calculation flow, which was entirely new and fundamentally different from Wireline. This included designing and implementing a bottom-up calculation approach, where every value must be derived from downstream assets upward.
Key contributions:

Delivered the Wireless AC calculation engine using a bottom-up method:
Panel → Breaker → RPP → PDU → UPS → UPS Bank

This bottom-down (bottom-up) approach was not present in Wireless earlier and required building a new calculation model from scratch.

Took ownership of HVAC load calculations, even though Wireless had very limited data compared to Wireline.

Designed the logic to compute cooling requirements, equipment impact, and total site heat load, adapting the formulas to the missing HVAC data.

Performed utilization calculations for AC assets:

Current Load

Anticipated Load

Budget Load

Utilized vs. Installed Capacity


Built the logic to determine whether an asset (UPS / RPP / PDU / HVAC / Generator) should be treated as Installed, Utilized, or Not Required, based on actual site data.

Ensured all AC, HVAC and utilization calculations aligned with DC-Track’s holistic data model for import without manual correction.

SECTION 2 — DC-Track ↔ C&D Sync, APIs, XML Generation, Budget Load Updates

I took complete responsibility for enabling synchronization between DC-Track and the C&D (Cyrus & DraftX) systems, which cannot directly communicate with DC-Track.
Major accomplishments:

Designed and built 10+ REST APIs to allow C&D to push required updates into DC-Track.

Created the DC-Track XML generation flow so that C&D could receive data in the exact format needed for their integration layer.

Developed the Budget Load Update API, enabling C&D to send calculated budget load values back to DC-Track for automatic updates.

Built API workflows for:

Cabinet creation sync

Breaker assignment sync

Budget load update

Asset status update

Cabinet attribute sync


Ensured seamless two-way synchronization between systems:
DC-Track → C&D → DC-Track

Validated all XML structures and ensured successful integration into C&D’s pipeline.

Helped stabilize the entire data sync layer between Wireless flow and DC-Track.

SECTION 3 — Siteview, Sub-Location Creation, Location Sync to ELS (Additional Contributions)

Beyond migration and calculations, I contributed significantly to location modeling, SiteView flows, and environment sync.
Key achievements:

Worked on the bulk upload design for SiteView — setting up the initial model for how Wireless assets and locations would be bulk-uploaded into the application.

Designed and implemented the creation of additional sub-locations required for Wireless flows (rooms, racks, cabinets, special sub-areas).

Built the logic to sync locations created in C&D → ELS, ensuring consistency between all three systems.

Contributed to the location mapping and correction flows, ensuring that every Wireless site had a correct hierarchical structure before migration.

Ensured consistency between SiteView, ELS, and DC-Track location models through validation and automated flows.

✅ Final Combined Summary (if needed)

(Optional – for performance summary box)

Across the year, I owned and delivered critical components across Wireless AC calculations, HVAC logic, utilization modeling, DC-Track ↔ C&D synchronization APIs, XML generation, Budget Load updates, SiteView flows, sub-location creation, and cross-system environment sync (C&D ↔ ELS). I introduced a bottom-up AC calculation model, automated multiple data flows, enabled new integration capabilities, and contributed to stabilizing the entire Wireless-to-DC-Track pipeline end-to-end.

Here's a clear and professional response you can send to your senior manager on Slack:

Hi Manoj,

I’ve provided access to all the required GitLab repositories for DRAFTX, CYRUS, and UNO modules.

I've also prepared a detailed application setup document that includes:

Steps to clone the repositories from GitLab

How to import the modules into respective IDEs (VS Code / STS / IntelliJ)

Build and run instructions for both frontend and backend

Placement details for the settings.xml file


You can start by reviewing the document, checking out the code, and importing the modules as per the instructions.

Also, please raise a request in AOS to get the required software tools (Maven, Git, Node.js, Java JDKs, etc.) installed if not already available.

Let me know once done — I’ll begin the setup tomorrow.

Let me know if you'd like me to attach the document along with this message or generate a .docx version for you to send directly.

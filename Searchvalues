Subject: Urgent Attention Needed: Site View Migration Progress

Hi [Manager's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I’d like to bring to your attention the current status of the Site View Migration feature. The progress on this has not been as expected, and there appears to be some confusion around ownership — whether it should be handled by a developer or a tester.

This is now becoming a blocker for the C&D team, preventing them from making progress on their dependent tasks. Moreover, this feature is critical for our upcoming soft launch at the end of August, and delays here could impact the overall timeline.

We are migrating around 23 sites as part of this, so it’s important that this is treated as a priority. I request your support in:

Clarifying and assigning clear ownership of the task.

Ensuring continuous progress without further slippage.

Having the team provide timely and clear updates via email.

Closely monitoring that nothing is missed and the work is fully taken care of.


Please help ensure the necessary focus is given, and let me know if you'd like to sync further on this.

Thanks for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Description:

Team Leadership, Collaboration & Vendor Engagement:

Took active ownership in guiding and collaborating with both internal teams and external vendors throughout the delivery cycle:

Engaged with TCS teams regularly to assign and track tasks. Monitored their daily progress via BSU updates, raised questions when required, and ensured alignment with overall delivery goals.

During production issues, provided clear RCA and solution directions to TCS, helping them resolve defects quickly with minimal business impact.

Worked closely with product teams (e.g., AOS) by performing initial analysis, breaking down story requirements, and handing off refined technical understanding to accelerate delivery.



Cross-Team Communication:

Maintained strong engagement with business teams, explaining complex flows like ELL, real-time, and migration scenarios, enabling them to understand the impact and align accordingly.

Supported colleagues (e.g., Manasa and Subiksha) by breaking down logic, guiding code changes, and enabling them to deliver their stories on time—demonstrating mentoring as well as collaborative leadership.


Use of Generative AI for Strategic Value:

Actively explored the use of Generative AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Gemini to enhance team productivity, accuracy, and reduce manual intervention in repetitive coding and validation tasks.

Continuously evaluating how GenAI can be leveraged further in:

Reducing production bugs

Improving code consistency

Assisting with migrations

And ultimately, accelerating delivery across squads.



These efforts reflect a leadership approach that is proactive, collaborative, and innovation-driven, supporting business goals while mentoring the team and improving vendor effectiveness.

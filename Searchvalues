Hi Team,

For this site, a total of three cooling zones were reviewed. Currently, two zones have been successfully imported into DCTrack.

The remaining zone was not imported because its Sensitive Capacity is set to 0. In DCTrack, a cooling zone must have a non-zero capacity to be created or updated; zones with zero capacity are not supported.

Once the Sensitive Capacity is corrected and provided with a valid value, the remaining zone can also be imported without any issue.

Please confirm after updating the capacity so we can proceed.

Thanks,
Naveen

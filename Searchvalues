Got it 👍 You want a flowchart-style representation of the AC power chain (from UPS → UPS Bank → Load Devices → Floor PDU → Local Panel → Local Panel Breakers → RPP → RPP Panels → RPP Panel Breakers).

Here’s a diagrammatic written format you can directly use in your PPT or documentation:


---

AC Power Flow Chain

1. UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)
⬇️
2. UPS Bank

Connected through Load Devices

UPS → Load Device → UPS Bank

UPS Bank → Load Device → Floor PDU
⬇️
3. Floor PDU (Power Distribution Unit)
⬇️
4. Local Panel (inside Floor PDU)
⬇️
5. Local Panel Breakers


Breakers inside the local panel connect Floor PDU → RPP
⬇️
6. RPP (Remote Power Panel)
⬇️
7. RPP Panels
⬇️
8. RPP Panel Breakers

These connect to Cabinets / Racks for Equipment Load

✅ This clearly shows the step-by-step hierarchy of how AC power flows in your migration project.

👉 Do you also want me to convert this into a proper diagram (boxes and arrows flowchart) in PPT / PNG format so that you can directly paste it in your presentation?

📄 Description:
As part of the 1PSC ELS migration process for 37 third-party data center sites, we need to document a guideline template for post-migration validation. This document will help users understand:

Where and how to view the migrated location, floor, and room details in 1PSC ELS

Which screens display this information

How this data appears when mapped into a single PSE view


Key Points:

Include relevant screenshots from 1PSC ELS that show:

Location name

Floor details

Room hierarchy under each site

Mapping view when opening a PSE in 1PSC


Clearly label each screenshot and annotate if necessary

This template will serve as a user-facing reference document

It can be used by QA, business users, or new team members during validation

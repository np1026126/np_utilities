> Hi everyone,
As you know, there are two types of breaker mappings — breaker to others and breaker to cabinets.

For the DC part, we were focusing on preparing the breaker-to-cabinet sheets, since it involves multiple dependent components — the load devices, ports, connectors, and VIPs — all of which must be correctly aligned before pushing the data.

Since most of the information was still being finalized from USAID, and the latest data snapshot was taken only on Saturday, there were new updates, naming convention corrections, and location-related adjustments that needed to be fixed before we could proceed with the breaker-to-cabinet load. This required additional time to ensure the device-to-connector mappings were accurate for the DC environment.

Because the breaker-to-cabinet activity was not part of the day-one scope, we prioritized running all mappings as breaker to others first. This was done intentionally so that when users review the data, they can clearly see which poles are already occupied and get an overall view of the current state.

The team has been finalizing the breaker-to-cabinet preparation in parallel. We will now proceed with creating the updated sheet, cross-verifying the mappings, and executing that load next.

Would you like me to make a slightly crisper version (for Slack or email) that’s one short paragraph but keeps the same message?

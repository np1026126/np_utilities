Got it. This is a process / ownership clarification issue, and you’re right to be careful because you were not part of the IFP-side execution. The safest and most professional approach is to:

1. Acknowledge the concern


2. State facts of the migration clearly


3. Clarify what was / was not in scope


4. Redirect ownership without sounding defensive


5. Propose next steps



Below is a clear understanding first, then a ready-to-send response to Suresh.

What users are actually asking (very clearly)

They are saying:

FDR request was created before 11/03

FDR approval happened after 11/03

Because approval happened later, Reserve Power / Anticipated Load was updated in IFP after 11/03

Migration snapshot was taken on 11/02 (and 11/01)

Therefore, Reserve Power values updated post-snapshot in IFP did not move to 1PSC


👉 Users are not blaming the migration technically, they are saying:

> “Our Reserve Power values changed in IFP after the snapshot, so 1PSC doesn’t reflect the final approved values.”



This is a timing + governance gap, not a bug.

The key truth you should state (very important)

Migration was a point-in-time snapshot

Any updates made in IFP after the snapshot were out of scope

Post-cutover, IFP should not have been used

You were not involved in IFP-side approvals or post-cutover updates



---

What you should NOT say ❌

Don’t accept blame

Don’t say “we missed it”

Don’t imply migration failure

Don’t promise retro-migration



---

What you SHOULD say ✅

State facts

Clarify ownership

Ask for alignment

Suggest a governance decision

Suggested response:

> Thanks for detailing the scenario, Suresh. Let me clarify the migration boundary from our side.

The IFP → 1PSC migration was executed as a point-in-time snapshot based on IFP data available up to 11/02, following the communicated freeze starting 11/01. Any Reserve Power / Anticipated Load values present in IFP at that time were migrated as-is into 1PSC.

If FDR approvals occurred after 11/03 and resulted in additional Reserve Power updates being made in IFP post-snapshot, those changes would not have been captured, as post-cutover updates in IFP were out of scope by design.

I was not involved in the IFP-side PSR/FDR execution or approval workflows, so I can’t speak to why updates continued in IFP after cutover. From a system-of-record standpoint, all post-11/03 work should have transitioned to 1PSC.

I agree we should align on next steps—whether this requires a business reconciliation, a one-time data correction strategy, or process reinforcement to prevent parallel updates going forward. Happy to discuss further with the right IFP stakeholders included.

If you want a shorter Slack version

> Migration was a snapshot up to 11/02 per the freeze. Any Reserve Power updates done in IFP after cutover (post-11/03 approvals) would not be reflected in 1PSC by design. I wasn’t involved in IFP-side PSR/FDR execution, but we should align on remediation or governance to avoid parallel updates.

Bottom line (for your confidence)

You are not responsible for IFP being used post-cutover

This is not a migration defect

This is a process violation / timing gap

You’re doing the right thing by factually clarifying and escalating for alignment


If you want, I can:

Help you tighten the tone (more firm / more diplomatic)

Draft a follow-up action list

Create a 1-slide timeline you can attach to end this debate cleanly


Just tell me how you want to handle it 👍

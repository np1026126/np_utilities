Here’s a professional way to draft the Slack message based on your situation:


---

Hi Team,

As per my manager’s request, I have provided access to UAT and PROD environments for the 11 users since I had the necessary privileges.

However, for PLE, we did not have admin privileges to grant access ourselves. We raised a CANVAS ticket, but it was not addressed. We requested admin privileges so we could manage it internally, but the request kept getting routed to multiple people, including Areeb, Areeb Babu, and Vinod, with no resolution.

Eventually, Munindra helped escalate the issue, involving Rakshit (even Calvin tried reaching him), and Rakshit confirmed that he has the necessary access to complete it. The team has also confirmed they cannot provide admin privileges to us.

As of now, Rakshit is working on the ticket, and once it is resolved, the users will have the required PLE access.

If you want, I can make it even more concise for a quick Slack update. Would you like me to do that?

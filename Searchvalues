Subject: Sunbird Tickets Created for RPP/PDU Template and Feature Limitations

Dear Team,

As discussed in the earlier migration call and as per the summary shared by Pete, I have created three Sunbird support tickets to address the current limitations we are facing during RPP and PDU onboarding via the template.

Below are the ticket details:

1. Support for RPP and PDU Room Mapping in Template Upload
Ticket Link: 71704


2. Enable Bulk Edit of Location/Room Fields Post Upload
Ticket Link: 71705


3. Add Real-Time kW/kVA and Phase-Wise Readings at the PDU Level
Ticket Link: 71706



Please let me know if any additional information is needed for these tickets. Once we receive an update from Sunbird, I will coordinate with Andy and the team to proceed accordingly.

Thanks & Regards,
Naveen

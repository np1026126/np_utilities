Got it. I’ve updated the email to include the point about scope changes causing missed deadlines twice before, and now since the commitment is already made, the feature must be completed as planned.

Here’s the final professional version:

Subject: Support Required Over the Weekend for Calculation Feature Completion

Dear Team,

As you know, we have committed to completing the Calculation Feature by Monday. This commitment was given by the development team itself, and we have communicated this date to the users accordingly.

However, given the recent scope changes, the deadline had to be revised twice earlier. Now, since we have committed to this Monday date, it is important that we complete the feature as planned to honor the commitment made.

Considering the current progress, it appears that completing the work within the weekday timelines alone may not be feasible. Therefore, to meet the Monday deadline, I request your support over the weekend to complete the pending tasks and ensure we deliver on time.

Your cooperation is essential to successfully meet this commitment.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also give you a shorter, Slack-friendly version for quick communication. Would you like me to prepare that?

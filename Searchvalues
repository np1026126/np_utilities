Got it üëç Since this is a different bug (panel breaker pole validation issue), here‚Äôs a proper draft you can raise with the Sunbird team.

Subject: DCTrack Import Error ‚Äì Panel Breaker Pole Validation Issue

Description:
While importing breaker data through CSV into DCTrack, we are consistently facing validation errors related to panel breakers.

The error shown during import:
‚ÄúPanel breaker set at Starting Pole No. <X> does not exist.‚Äù

However, upon verifying in DCTrack for the same location, the panel breaker does exist at the specified pole position.

This issue is repeating for multiple locations and panels, making it a blocker for breaker imports.


Steps to Reproduce:

1. Export breaker data from DCTrack (CSV).


2. Without modifying any values, attempt to re-import the same file.


3. Observe the import results ‚Äì errors such as ‚ÄúPanel breaker set at Starting Pole does not exist‚Äù are displayed.



Observed Behavior:

System incorrectly throws validation errors for breakers that are actually present in DCTrack.

Breakers at the specified pole numbers are visible in the panel but still flagged as missing.


Expected Behavior:

The import process should validate against the existing breaker positions correctly.

If the breaker exists at the mentioned pole, the system should not throw errors.


Sample Affected Assets:

Example: Breaker at Panel RPP A31, Pole 20

Example: Breaker at Panel Cab 1523 A, Pole 205


Impact:

Import jobs are failing for multiple locations.

Breaker data updates are blocked, affecting data accuracy.

üëâ You can also attach the error screenshot (as you shared) along with the CSV file you used for import. This will help Sunbird reproduce and debug faster.

Do you want me to combine both issues (system error + pole validation error) into a single consolidated ticket or keep them as two separate bugs for clarity?

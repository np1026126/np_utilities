🔧 Summary of Observations, Issues & Assumptions – Windsor Site (Asset Imports from FUZE to DCTrack)

Dear Team,

Below is a consolidated summary of the issues encountered and the assumptions made while processing the Windsor site asset data from FUZE to be uploaded into DCTrack. Your confirmation or clarification on the below points will help ensure accurate data loading and system functionality:


---

🟧 1. Generator

The following three values — Rating (kVA), Rating (kW), and Rating (A) — are currently being derived using formulas based on GEN_SIZE:

kVA = ROUND(GEN_SIZE * 1.25)

KW = GEN_SIZE

Amps = ROUND(GEN_SIZE * 1.5)


⚠️ Assumption: These formulas are correct representations of generator power rating logic.

📌 Request: Please confirm if this method of deriving ratings from GEN_SIZE is valid, or if an alternate method is preferred.

Additionally, a few generator values from FUZE appear to be incorrect or inconsistent with known capacity standards.



---

🟧 2. HVAC

We are unable to locate zone load and TotalITNonEquipHeat values within the FUZE data dump.

⚠️ These fields are critical for power/cooling calculations within DCTrack.

📌 Request: Can these values be provided or extracted directly from FUZE?



---

🟧 3. Battery

The field “Belongs To” (UPS or Plant) is often marked as None, which breaks the association logic.

🔺 Expected: Either a valid UPS name or Plant name must be provided to allow linkage and mapping.


String Number / Index String: Missing for several entries. These are required to define battery groups or banks within plants.

⚠️ Issue: Batteries in FUZE don’t always indicate which plant they’re connected to.

📌 Request: Kindly confirm how we can reliably identify and link batteries to respective UPS or plant in absence of this data.



---

🟧 4. UPS

UPS entries are being created based on PDU naming convention from CP&G.

For each site, we are taking the maximum load of one UPS and replicating it across other UPS units — ⚠️ a temporary assumption made due to lack of detailed per-unit data.

⚙️ Amps calculation for UPS bank is being derived assuming Power Factor (PF) = 1.

Load devices downstream (like PDUs) are also being calculated based on UPS-PDU count linkage and this PF factor.

📌 Request: Please verify if using PF=1 and mirrored max load across UPS units is an acceptable approach.



---

🟧 5. BDFB / Panel Breakers

For Panel Breakers, the cabinet value is derived from the associated breaker message in IFP.

However, ⚠️ most breaker records do not contain cabinet details, making them unmappable to actual panel layout.

📌 Request: Can additional data or mapping logic be provided to align breaker positions within DCTrack cabinets?

✅ Summary of Actions Needed:

Asset	Action Requested

Generator	Confirm formula usage for rating derivation
HVAC	Provide zone load and TotalITNonEquipHeat
Battery	Confirm logic to identify belonging (Plant/UPS), and String number
UPS	Validate assumption: max load + PF=1
Panel Breakers	Guidance on cabinet mapping when missing



---

We await your confirmation or recommended adjustments before proceeding with final asset migration into DCTrack. This will ensure data integrity and operational consistency during and after the soft launch.

Best regards,
Your Name

Here is a fully updated, polished, Workday-ready “Lead My Team / Operational Excellence” section, now including your leadership of interns, freshers, and exiting team members, and how you still delivered high-quality work under pressure.

This version seamlessly blends with the earlier content and strengthens your leadership impact.

⭐ Lead My Team – Team Leadership, Collaboration & Vendor Engagement (Final Updated Version)

Demonstrated strong leadership, ownership, and cross-functional collaboration throughout major migration cycles, production support, and continuous delivery activities. Leveraged deep PSC & DC-Track domain expertise to guide teams, vendors, and business users while ensuring high-quality outcomes even during resource constraints.


---

Team Leadership, Coaching & Delivery Ownership

Took complete ownership of complex migration and integration stories—breaking down technical requirements, preparing LLDs, clarifying logic, and guiding team members from start to finish.

Successfully led and mentored three newly joined interns assigned for the migration project during the last 2–2.5 months. Trained them on PSC domain, DC-Track, power chain flows, SQL extraction, and mapping rules, enabling them to contribute meaningfully in a short time.

Managed and delivered stories even when freshers and team members who were serving notice period were assigned under my guidance. Ensured consistency in quality and helped them understand story logic quickly despite limited ramp-up time.

Demonstrated strong ownership by delivering migrations, fallback fixes, and calculations within deadlines despite team instability and resource churn.

Provided continuous mentoring—explaining complex logic (AC bottom-up calculations, HVAC flows, CND-DC-Track sync, budget-load updates), reviewing their work, and ensuring accuracy in all deliverables.



---

Vendor Engagement (TCS & External Partners)

Actively collaborated with TCS teams—providing story explanations, reviewing their technical understanding, guiding defect fixes, and ensuring alignment with architectural standards.

Monitored vendor progress regularly, provided corrections and clarifications, and ensured consistent quality across modules involving DC-Track sync, XML interfaces, and migration scripts.

Played a central role in bridging communication between architects, product teams, and vendors for smooth execution.



---

Stakeholder & User Engagement

Maintained strong engagement with wireless and wireline users—clarifying their doubts, demonstrating DC-Track operations, power chain formation, site-level mapping, and resolving fallout issues quickly.

Coordinated closely with IFP, CPNG, FUSE, and CND teams to gather missing data, validate discrepancies, and align mapping decisions for multi-source migrations.

Built trust with users by responding promptly to issues, producing sample locations, validating site data, and ensuring accurate data loads.



---

Production Support – Tier 2, Tier 3 & Product Teams

Provided consistent support during production issues (AYS, sync failures, incorrect mappings) by coordinating directly with Tier 2 and Tier 3 teams.

Worked closely with product owners to identify root causes and deploy fixes safely.

Supported the product and engineering teams in refining logic, preventing regressions, and enhancing stability.



---

Architecture & Technical Design Alignment

Collaborated with architects and interface teams to validate designs, refine LLDs, and ensure scalable implementation of CND-to-DC-Track sync, budget-load workflows, and power chain logic.

Ensured alignment with business scenarios, system limitations, and long-term migration architecture.



---

Industry Research, Agentic AI & Innovation

Explored and adopted emerging Agentic AI approaches and GitHub Copilot/Gemini usage to improve migration workflows, reduce manual work, and accelerate SQL generation and validation.

Proposed ideas for AI-driven validation frameworks and automated regression checks.

Evaluated opportunities for introducing AI into PSE workflows and across PSC modules.



---

Cross-Team Influence & Domain Expertise

Acted as a domain expert in PSC, DC-Track, AC/DC power modelling, HVAC logic, and multi-source data flows.

Supported teams across squads by explaining asset relationships, naming conventions, mapping rules, and location hierarchies.

Provided valuable inputs to improve business logic, template structures, and flow calculations.

Added significant value to teams by bridging knowledge gaps between legacy systems (IFP, CPNG, FUSE), the target DC-Track system, and intermediate CND transformations.

⭐ Final Summary to Upload

Despite resource constraints, onboarding interns, guiding freshers, and handling multiple migrations, I consistently ensured high-quality delivery, strong team collaboration, and end-to-end ownership. My technical depth, mentoring, and cross-team coordination have significantly contributed to smoother migrations, stable production support, and increased team efficiency.

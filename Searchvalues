Got it 👍
What you want is not an explanation, but a clean, polished way to ask these questions on the call, without sounding confused, confrontational, or too technical-heavy.
Below is a refined, ready-to-say call script, broken into logical questions, using simple language, but still accurate for C&G / IFP / FUSE / PSE / PSR context.
You can read this almost as-is on the call.
🎯 How to ask this on the 1:1 call (polished & structured)
🔹 Opening context (30–40 seconds)
You can start like this:
“I wanted to understand the flow post-PSE completion from your side, so that we’re aligned on how things are actually being done today and where we should focus next.”
🔹 Question 1: What happens after PSE & vetting?
“Once the PSE is completed and the vetting is done in 1KC, what does the next step look like from your side?”
👉 This lets them explain naturally, without you assuming anything.
🔹 Question 2: Current process in C&G
“From there, how does the work move into C&G today? What activities are you currently performing in C&G after vetting?”
👉 This reveals:
Whether C&G is execution-heavy
Or mostly tracking / approvals
🔹 Question 3: PSR alignment check (very important)
“We see that PSRs are being set up for each FUSE ID or FUSE project ID. From your perspective, does that align with how the process is executed in C&G, or is there anything additional that happens outside of that?”
👉 This checks whether:
PSR = reality
Or PSR is only partial representation
🔹 Question 4: Comparison with IFP / FUSE
“Is this post-vetting flow similar to what you were earlier doing in IFP or FUSE, or are there differences in how the work gets completed?”
👉 This naturally brings out:
What IFP still does better
What has changed
What is duplicated
🔹 Question 5: Why IFP is still being used (key gap question)
“In which scenarios do you still need to go back to IFP today, and what typically drives that decision?”
👉 This is the most important question
Do not interrupt here.
🔹 Question 6: Gap identification (future-focused)
“From your point of view, what are the gaps today that prevent everything from being completed within the new application, especially for MSC?”
👉 This frames gaps as system gaps, not user issues.
🔹 Question 7: Next-phase prioritization
“If we were to address these in the next phase, what would you say are the top areas we should focus on so that, at least for MSC, there’s no dependency on IFP?”
👉 This gives you clear roadmap inputs.
🔹 Closing (positive & collaborative)
“This really helps us understand where to focus next. We’ll take this back and see how we can close these gaps in upcoming phases.”
🧠 Why this works
❌ No accusation (“why are you still using IFP?”)
❌ No assumption
✅ Lets user explain real workflow
✅ Clearly surfaces gaps
✅ Gives you MSC-specific improvement direction
📝 Pro tip for you
During the call, note answers under 4 headings:
What happens after vetting
What is done in C&G
Why IFP is still used
Gaps for MSC completion
This will make your post-call summary extremely strong.

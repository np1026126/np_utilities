Got it. If you’ve already uploaded the zip file in Google Gemini and you want it to open all three folders inside, scan through the eight sites, and then count all four assets (UPS, UPS Banks, PDU, and PDU Panels), here’s a clear prompt you can give:

Prompt for Google Gemini

I have uploaded a zip file with three folders: Branchburg, Colorado Springs, and NEC Sites.  
Each folder contains multiple files for up to eight sites total.  
Every site has data for four assets: UPS, UPS Banks, PDU, and PDU Panels.  

Please do the following:
1. Unzip the file and go into each folder.
2. For each site, open all files and count the number of data rows for each of the four asset types:  
   - UPS  
   - UPS Banks  
   - PDU  
   - PDU Panels
3. Give me a table with the counts per asset for each site and also a **grand total** for all sites combined.
4. Make sure the table includes counts **per site**, **per folder**, and **overall totals** at the end.

If you want NEC-only totals separately, just add this line at the end:

Also give a separate total for NEC Sites folder only.

If you like, I can also give you a variant prompt to ask Gemini to generate charts or summaries per folder automatically. Do you want me to prepare that too?

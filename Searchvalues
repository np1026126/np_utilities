✅ BDC-BB / BDCBB Panel Breakers – Comments Column Explanation

Description

The “Comments” column in the BDC-BB / BDCBB Panel Breakers tab is used only when a breaker position is mapped to a cabinet or load device.

When a breaker is CLOSED, it means that breaker position is actively feeding a cabinet or some equipment.

In such cases, the Comments column is used to record the following details:

Cabinet Name

Connector / Port Name

Device Name (if applicable)

Port Number / Load Device Port (AC or DC)

Any other mapping details that help identify what that breaker is powering.



You mentioned correctly:

✔ DCTrack does not require this data for import.
✔ This Comments section is only added by Verizon (C&D/VC team) during data preparation, for easy understanding by vendors during site survey or cross-verification.
✔ These values are pulled from the DB when available.

When Comments Will Be Blank

If a breaker position is OPEN, it means that breaker is not assigned to any cabinet or load device.

Therefore, no cabinet/port details exist.

So in these rows, Comments = blank, which is expected and correct.


Column Name Change?

No, the column name should not be changed.

It is intentionally named Comments because it contains free-text mapping details, not a fixed field.

▶️ Short Summary to Add in Mail

> The Comments column is used only when a breaker position is assigned to a cabinet or load device. For breakers in Closed status, you will see cabinet name, connector/port name, device name, port numbers, etc.—this helps vendors understand how that breaker is being used.
For Open breakers, the Comments column will be blank because no device is connected. The column name should remain “Comments” as it is not a fixed schema field in DCTrack but an informational field for clarity.

If you want, I can format this exactly like the previous asset sections (UPS, UPS Bank, RPP, PDU Panels etc.) so the entire clarification document is consistent.

Here is a polished, professional message including your additional point about MSE-specific data and the ticket raised to Joey:

Hi Ramana,

I connected with Suresh and collected the overall monthly login metrics.
Here is the update:

October 2025: 2,269 IFP user logins

November 2025: 1,542 IFP user logins
→ This shows a drop of ~700 users compared to October.


On the 1PSC side, the current active login count is around 231 users, which has remained consistent over the past few days.

Since the data received was for overall users, I requested them to extract the login metrics specific to MSE sites.
A ticket has been created to Joey from the IFP team, and he will provide the MSE-only user login data separately.

Attaching the gsheet snapshot for reference.
Please let me know if you need any additional split or trend analysis.

If you want, I can also help you prepare a one-slide summary for your meeting.

Got it 👍 You’re basically simplifying HVAC planning data and showing real, usable cooling capacity instead of confusing planned numbers. Let me translate this into clear, user-friendly feature text and benefits.
🔹 Feature Description (2 concise lines – user facing)
Option 1 (Simple & clear):
This feature displays real-time HVAC cooling capacity by excluding planned values and calculating available tons after accounting for anticipated heat load. It helps users quickly understand usable cooling capacity at the zone level for better equipment planning.
Option 2 (Slightly more functional):
The HVAC summary shows total cooling tons, available equipment, zones, and remaining cooling capacity after subtracting anticipated heat load. This enables accurate assessment of cooling availability for new equipment placement.
Option 3 (Very crisp – product style):
Provides a consolidated HVAC view showing actual cooling availability by adjusting total capacity against anticipated heat load at the zone level.
🔹 What exactly is shown (you can add as a tooltip or sub-text)
The HVAC section displays:
Total Cooling Tons
Total Available Equipment
Total Zones
Remaining Cooling Capacity (after new heat load)
(Calculated by subtracting anticipated heat generated by equipment from total HVAC capacity.)
🔹 User Benefits (this is the key part 👍)
🧑‍💼 Why this is useful for the user
Removes confusion – Eliminates planned HVAC values and shows only actionable cooling data.
Accurate capacity planning – Users can clearly see how much cooling is actually available after new heat loads.
Faster decision-making – No manual calculations needed to check if a zone can support new equipment.
Zone-level visibility – Helps users identify which zones have sufficient cooling capacity.
Prevents overloading – Reduces risk of adding equipment beyond available cooling limits.
🔹 Ultra-short benefit line (if you need just one line)
Helps users quickly assess real cooling availability and safely plan new equipment based on actual heat capacity.
🔹 If you want it more “executive-level”
This enhancement improves HVAC capacity visibility by replacing planned values with calculated cooling availability, enabling safer and more accurate equipment placement decisions.
If you want, I can:
Rewrite this for Jira Feature / Story format
Convert it into Release Notes language
Make it more technical or more business-friendly
Just tell me where this text will be used 👌

Got it, Naveen.
You want:

✔ A single, long, comprehensive list of achievement points

✔ Covering everything you already wrote in the screenshot

✔ PLUS all the additional migration + AI + calculation + integration work you narrated

✔ Because this is a full 1-year performance review

I will not rewrite or shorten your points —
I will retain every point you mentioned, add the missing ones, and structure everything clearly.

⭐ FULL-YEAR PERFORMANCE ACHIEVEMENTS (ALL POINTS INCLUDED)

(You can directly copy-paste this into your goal section)


---

1. Major Migration Delivery & Execution

Led and delivered multiple key migration and integration activities for Power & Cooling (P&C) inventory as part of 1PSC, ensuring smooth transition, data integrity, and business continuity.

Executed the migration of P&C inventory templates from IFP into DC-Track, aligning with the holistic data model and maintaining full traceability.

Supported the migration of MSC, CND, and CNB datasets into DC-Track, including sub-location and room-level data validations.

Enabled asset mapping from IFP floor plans into DraftX Space service, enhancing spatial alignment and visualization.

Drove site-level location mapping into 1PSC, including creation of sub-location structure and enabling accurate navigation.



---

2. Structured Mapping of Unstructured Legacy Data

Managed major challenges in unstructured IFP data, where all assets were stored in a single EDU table without hierarchy, parent-child relationships, or consistent power-chain mapping.

Developed complete mapping logic to align CP&G, CPNG, IFP, and FUSE assets to DC-Track holistic templates.

Standardized data formats across 28 assets and ensured cross-system data model consistency.

Created end-to-end mapping schema for all three source systems (IFP, CPNG, FUSE) against DC-Track templates.



---

3. Site Creation & Validation

Performed detailed site creation validation for CND→ELS transitions, eliminating configuration errors and mismatches.

Delivered room naming standards, power chain standards, rack/space alignment, and structured data consolidation for multiple environments.



---

4. SQL, Oracle, and Template Logic Development

Developed Microsoft SQL Server scripts to fetch and validate P&C data across 144 MSC sites.

Built multiple Oracle SQL scripts for retrieving, validating, and transforming MSC data.

Created logic to standardize templates, align asset structures, define required fields, and ensure import-readiness.



---

5. Successful Completion of Large-Scale Migration

Successfully migrated IFP active users into 1PSC with full continuity of access.

Completed user-to-workgroup mapping for accurate onboarding within 1PSC.



---

6. AI-Driven Automation (Gemini + GitHub Copilot)

Used Gemini AI to upload all schema diagrams, unify table structures, and automatically generate cross-system mapping.

Used Copilot to auto-generate SQL queries, Python scripts, and extraction logic aligned with DC-Track requirements.

Automated the entire workflow: schema mapping → SQL generation → extraction → template creation.

Reduced manual effort by 80–90% through AI-based automation.



---

7. Multi-System Data Extraction Automation (142 Locations)

Created a master location-ID mapping (IFP-ID / CPNG-ID / FUSE-ID) for all locations to support automation.

Built Python automation (via Copilot prompts) to loop through all IDs and extract all 28 assets for each site.

Generated 142 Excel workbooks, each containing 28 asset tabs, fully validated and import-ready.

Achieved consistent, complete extraction for all sites in a single automated run.



---

8. Post-Migration Fallout Resolution

Handled ~10% fallout due to unexpected changes to breaker→cabinet relationships and template restrictions.

When DC-Track Excel import/export couldn’t update records, designed an AI-generated API-based correction workflow.

Developed a Python script to read failed Excel records and update them directly via the DC-Track REST API.

Successfully remediated all fallout entries and delivered clean, error-free data.



---

9. AC, DC & HVAC Calculations Ownership

Complete ownership of wireless AC flow calculations (totally different from wireline logic).

Implemented bottom-up calculation model for UPS → Load Device → PDU → RPP → Panel.

Designed logic for anticipated load, current load, breaker load, and device continuity.

Performed HVAC cooling calculations and maintained consistency with DC-Track requirements.



---

10. Breaker Assignment & Cabinet Migration

Mid-way through migration, supported urgent requirement to bring cabinets into the wireless flow.

Delivered cabinet mapping, calculating cabinet current load, anticipated load, and breaker assignment logic.

Implemented methods for validating load distribution across the cabinet and associated downstream devices.



---

11. C&V ↔ DC-Track Cross-System Integration

Implemented DC-Track → C&V → DC-Track sync flow for cabinet creation, updates, and ITOP completion.

Ensured accurate upstream/downstream integration between systems for model continuity.

Designed enhancements for cabinet creation, assignment, and synchronization in multiple environments.



---

12. Use of AI for Late-Stage Problem Solving

Created Gemini/Copilot prompts to fix schema mismatches, generate missing join logic, and auto-repair mapping gaps.

Used AI to auto-identify column correlations across IFP, CPNG, and FUSE where definitions were unclear.



---

13. Overall Quality & Delivery Excellence

Played a key role in improving data readiness, template correctness, and mapping standardization.

Helped achieve near-zero production defects and >95% on-time delivery.

Established a reusable automation framework that can be extended to future migrations.

Got it 👍 — here’s your refined third clarification question, with the extra point about UPS Bank vs UPS:

Draft Question to Users:

> I’d like to confirm the treatment of UPS vs UPS Bank in our calculations.

In the current AC power flow, the PDU is not directly connected to the UPS — it is connected only to the UPS Bank. As part of DC-Track, we also see this structure, where the UPS relationship is maintained at the UPS Bank level.

Given this, is it acceptable for us to calculate and maintain all values (UPS Rating in kW, anticipated load, remaining utilization, etc.) directly at the UPS Bank level, rather than at the individual UPS level?

In other words, can we treat the UPS Bank as the effective entity for power flow and reporting, and record all load and rating values at the Bank level, since that is the point of connection to the PDUs?

👉 This version emphasizes clearly why you’re asking (because PDUs never connect to UPS directly, only to UPS Bank) and frames it in a way the users can validate easily.

Do you also want me to now merge all three of your clarification points (UPS load formula, anticipated load roll-up, and UPS vs UPS Bank) into a single professional mail draft you can send to Andres/users? That way it’s all bundled as one clarification request.

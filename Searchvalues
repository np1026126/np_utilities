Here’s a professional and structured version of your migration plan notes for the AC and DC asset flow, describing dependencies, rules, and expected issues clearly:

Asset Migration Notes – AC & DC Flow

1. UPS and UPS Bank Migration

Rules / Dependencies:

UPS assets must be imported successfully before proceeding with UPS Bank creation.

Both UPS and UPS Bank must exist before Load Devices can be created.


Known Issues / Risks:

Multiple custom fields exist for UPS across environments (DEV, SIT, PLE, PROD).

The field names and column mappings differ between environments, causing import failures during migration.

These discrepancies must be standardized before migration to avoid rework and data rejection.


Action Required:

Review and align UPS custom field structures across all environments.

Validate UPS import templates and perform a trial import before final migration.




---

2. Load Device Migration

Rules / Dependencies:

Load Devices can only be imported after UPS and UPS Bank are successfully migrated.


Known Issues / Risks:

Any incorrect or missing link between UPS and UPS Bank will cause Load Device import failures.

Ensure power source references are properly configured.




---

3. Floor PDU Migration

Rules / Dependencies:

Floor PDUs depend on Load Devices, as their power source must already be created.

Only after Load Device migration is complete can Floor PDUs be initiated.


Known Issues / Risks:

Any mismatch between Load Device references and Floor PDU templates may cause validation errors.

Configuration consistency across environments (template structure, connector mapping) is critical.




---

4. RPP and Related Panels

Rules / Dependencies:

RPP Panels should be created after Floor PDUs are successfully migrated.

Breaker connections (e.g., PDU Panel Breaker, RPP Panel Breaker) must be revalidated post-import.


Known Issues / Risks:

Breaker-to-Panel relationships may fail if dependent asset IDs are missing or renamed during import.

Validation errors can occur due to inconsistent naming conventions.




---

5. General Migration Challenges

Environment-specific configurations: Variations between environments lead to mismatched field names and data formats.

Import validation failures: Caused by missing dependencies or incorrect mappings.

Dependency sequencing: Incorrect order of migration can lead to relational gaps between assets.

Data completeness: Missing mandatory fields (e.g., “Power Source,” “Belongs To,” “Load Capacity”) will result in rejections.

6. Recommended Approach

1. Validate templates and mappings for all asset types before starting migration.


2. Conduct trial imports for UPS and UPS Bank in a lower environment.


3. Establish a dependency-based migration order:

UPS → UPS Bank → Load Device → Floor PDU → RPP Panel → Breakers.



4. Document all failures and fixes for each migration phase to maintain traceability.

Would you like me to help you add tentative migration dates and duration for each phase next (e.g., “UPS migration – 3 days,” “Load Devices – 2 days,” etc.) so you can present it as a complete migration plan?

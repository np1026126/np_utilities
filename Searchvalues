Absolutely Naveen — I will now give you two things:

1️⃣ Exact words to speak for each slide (You can read this exactly in your video)
2️⃣ How to import this PPT into Google Slides (so you can edit/record smoothly)

This will make your final presentation clear, professional, and easy to record.

✅ 1. EXACT WORDS TO SPEAK FOR EACH SLIDE

(This is your video narration script — you can simply read it line by line.)


---

🎬 Slide 1 — “AI-Driven Wireless Migration”

Speak: “Hi everyone, this is Naveen. In this presentation, I’ll walk through how we used AI tools to accelerate our wireless network migration from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE into DC-Track.
Our focus is on how AI reduced time, standardized our process, and helped us handle three different systems efficiently.”


---

⭐ Slide 2 — “Migration Challenge”

Speak: “The data available to us from the three legacy systems was completely unstructured.
We didn’t receive direct export files — all we had were schema diagrams and ER models.
Each system had different column names, different tables, and different ways of storing the same assets.
This made manual mapping highly time-consuming.”


---

⭐ Slide 3 — “Why AI Was Needed”

Speak: “Manually comparing three schema structures, identifying tables, and creating field mapping would have taken several weeks.
Joins across multiple databases were also complex.
We wanted to avoid fallout due to manual errors.
So AI was essential to speed up analysis and ensure accuracy.”


---

⭐ Slide 4 — “How AI Helped”

Speak: “AI helped us understand schema images, interpret the structure, and identify relevant tables instantly.
It also helped us create the mapping logic between DC-Track columns and the corresponding columns in IFP, CPNG, and FUSE.
This reduced effort drastically, especially when dealing with multiple assets.”


---

⭐ Slide 5 — “Step 1: DC-Track Holistic Templates”

Speak: “Our first step was to build holistic templates for each asset in DC-Track.
These templates define the exact columns, formats, and fields required by DC-Track.
This became the target model for the entire migration.”


---

⭐ Slide 6 — “Step 2: Gemini Schema Analysis”

Speak: “Next, we took the schema diagrams from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE and uploaded them into Gemini.
Gemini helped us identify which tables and columns were relevant for each asset.
It matched our DC-Track template fields with the source system tables by reading the schema image, which saved a lot of time.”


---

⭐ Slide 7 — “Step 3: Gemini Mapping Output”

Speak: “Gemini then generated a structured mapping table that clearly showed:
DC-Track column → IFP table.column → CPNG table.column → FUSE table.column.
This mapping became our source-of-truth for every asset type.”


---

⭐ Slide 8 — “Step 4: Copilot SQL Generation”

Speak: “Once the mapping was ready, we passed it into GitHub Copilot.
Copilot generated SQL queries automatically — including joins, filters, and aliases to match the DC-Track format.
This allowed us to extract asset data from three different databases very quickly.”


---

⭐ Slide 9 — “Step 5: Data Extraction”

Speak: “We executed Copilot-generated SQL queries across all systems and exported the data into CSV files.
These CSVs were aligned directly with our DC-Track holistic template, making the import much easier.”


---

⭐ Slide 10 — “Step 6: Fallout Fixing”

Speak: “When we imported the data into DC-Track, we received fallout for missing or mismatched fields.
We used AI again to analyze these fallout messages and identify what corrections were needed.
This helped us fix issues quickly and reduce manual debugging.”


---

⭐ Slide 11 — “Key Benefits”

Speak: “Using AI reduced our development and analysis time by nearly 80–90%.
It helped us maintain consistency across three different systems and improved data accuracy.
This approach is reusable for future PSC and wireless migrations.”


---

⭐ Slide 12 — “Conclusion”

Speak: “To summarize, AI helped us convert unstructured schema diagrams into DC-Track-ready data quickly and accurately.
We were able to bring three different systems into one unified model within a short period.
This enabled faster migration, higher quality, and a scalable approach for upcoming migrations. Thank you.”

🎯 NEC MIGRATION – MVP FEATURE BREAKDOWN
🟦 FEATURE 1: Create Missing Power Chain Components for NEC Sites (Data Completion)
Feature Objective
Ensure all NEC sites have a complete and valid power chain by creating missing logical components required for mapping, without changing user-provided asset data.
Why this feature is needed
User-provided NEC data does not include:
Load devices for UPS → UPS Bank → Floor PDU
Floor PDU Panels
Floor PDU Panel Breakers
These are mandatory in DCPAC to form a valid power chain.
📌 Scope (IN)
Create Load Devices to map:
UPS → UPS Bank
UPS Bank → Floor PDU
Create:
Floor PDU Panels
Floor PDU Panel Breakers
Ensure consistency with MSC migration model
No dependency on user data correction
🚫 Scope (OUT)
No renaming of user assets
No breaker reassignment using corrected data
No production import
🧩 Stories under Feature 1
Story 1.1: Create Load Devices for NEC Power Chain
Owner: Backend / Migration Engineer
Story:
As a migration engineer,
I want to create load devices between UPS, UPS Bank, and Floor PDU,
So that NEC sites have a complete upstream power chain.
Acceptance Criteria:
Load devices exist for all NEC UPS → UPS Bank → Floor PDU
Power chain validation passes
No orphaned Floor PDUs
Story 1.2: Create Floor PDU Panels
Owner: Backend / Data Engineer
Acceptance Criteria:
Each Floor PDU has required panels
Panel naming follows MSC standard
Panels are created only where missing
Story 1.3: Create Floor PDU Panel Breakers
Owner: Backend / Data Engineer
Acceptance Criteria:
Breakers created under Floor PDU panels
Breakers enable downstream RPP connection
Breaker structure matches MSC reference
✅ Feature 1 – Definition of Done
End-to-end power chain exists up to Floor PDU
No validation errors related to missing components
Data ready for corrected breaker assignment
🟦 FEATURE 2: Correct NEC Asset Data and Load Breaker Mapping (PLD)
Feature Objective
Correct NEC asset data issues (naming, hierarchy, redundancy) and load validated breaker assignments into PLD, aligned with ISP and DCPAC standards.
📌 Scope (IN)
Correct:
Silicode conflicts
RPP / panel naming mismatches
Redundancy alignment (RPPA / RPPB)
Room name mismatches
Naming convention issues
Load corrected breaker assignments into PLD
Validate mapping against ISP
🚫 Scope (OUT)
No production import
No structural power chain creation (handled in Feature 1)
🧩 Stories under Feature 2
Story 2.1: Correct NEC Location & Asset Naming Issues
Owner: Data Analyst / Business + Tech
Acceptance Criteria:
NEC Silicodes are unique
Room names match ISP
Naming conventions normalized
Story 2.2: Align RPP A/B Panels for Redundancy
Owner: Backend / DCPAC SME
Acceptance Criteria:
RPPA and RPPB have identical panel names
Redundancy pack works correctly
Panel changes sync across A/B sides
Story 2.3: Load Corrected Breaker Assignments into PLD
Owner: Data Engineer
Acceptance Criteria:
All breakers map successfully
No unmapped RPP / panel breakers
PLD validation passes
✅ Feature 2 – Definition of Done
PLD contains only corrected NEC data
100% breaker mapping success
No ISP comparison errors
🟦 FEATURE 3: Import NEC MVP Data into Production
Feature Objective
Safely deploy NEC MVP data into Production DCPAC without impacting existing MSC data.
📌 Scope (IN)
Import NEC MVP data from PLD to PROD
Validate:
Power chain integrity
Redundancy behavior
No MSC data regression
Post-deployment verification
🚫 Scope (OUT)
No further data corrections
No structural changes post-import
🧩 Stories under Feature 3
Story 3.1: Prepare NEC MVP Production Import
Owner: Migration Lead
Acceptance Criteria:
PLD sign-off received
Import checklist approved
Rollback plan documented
Story 3.2: Execute NEC Production Import
Owner: DevOps / Migration Engineer
Acceptance Criteria:
NEC assets visible in PROD
No MSC overwrite
Import completes without errors
Story 3.3: Post-Import Validation
Owner: QA / Business
Acceptance Criteria:
Power chain verified
Redundancy verified
Business sign-off received
✅ Feature 3 – Definition of Done

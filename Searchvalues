Gotcha 👍 You want one smooth paragraph, not bullet headings — something that reads naturally as user benefits. Here you go:
User Benefits (Single flowing description)
This feature removes reliance on planned HVAC values and presents only real, usable cooling capacity, allowing users to clearly understand how much cooling is actually available. By automatically accounting for anticipated heat load from equipment, it eliminates manual calculations and reduces the risk of overloading HVAC zones. With clear zone-level visibility into total cooling tons, available equipment, and remaining capacity, users can make faster, more accurate decisions when planning and placing new equipment.
Slightly shorter version (if space is tight)
This feature provides clear visibility into actual HVAC cooling availability by adjusting total capacity against anticipated heat load, enabling faster, safer equipment planning while eliminating manual calculations and guesswork.
If you want it even simpler, more technical, or more executive-friendly, tell me the target audience (end user / architect / manager) and I’ll tune the language exactly for that.

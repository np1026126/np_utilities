I am providing two CSV files:  
1. Original sheet with 4000 records.  
2. Failed sheet with ~2000 records containing an "Error and Warning" column.  

Tasks:
1. Read both CSVs fully.
2. For each record in the failed sheet where the error says "Position in row not available" or "Duplicate row label + position in row":
   - Generate a **new row label** (1–300) and **new position in row** (1–99) so that:
     - For each unique Location (string before ">" in the Location column), the combination of row label + position in row is unique.
     - The same combination must not appear in the original sheet or the already fixed rows.
   - `Position in row` cannot be zero.
3. Preserve all other columns as they are.
4. Output a corrected CSV with the same structure as the original, but with fixed `row label` and `position in row` values for the failed rows.
5. Ensure there are **no duplicates** within each location after correction.

Give me the final corrected CSV as output.

Subject: Clarification Needed on HVAC Formula ‚Äì Anticipated Equipment Heat Load

Hi Team,

As discussed in our last user call, the Anticipated Equipment Heat Load in HVAC Zone (Tons) was considered as Total Equipment Heat in Tons.

However, when we analyzed it further, we noticed that even for New Heat Load in Tons, the formula is also using the same value (Total Equipment Heat in Tons). This means both fields are currently ending up with the same value, which creates ambiguity.

I had a follow-up discussion with Lee on this point. His suggestion was that instead of duplicating the same value, the Anticipated Equipment Heat Load in HVAC Zone could be considered as the sum of all anticipated loads of all PSEs placed for that particular zone (i.e., the combined total equipment heat values of all PSEs in the zone).

This was a good proposal, but Lee also mentioned that it should be confirmed with the broader team before finalizing.

As of now, we are still considering ‚ÄúTotal Equipment Heat in Tons‚Äù for the Anticipated Equipment Heat Load field.
Can we please have a short call with all stakeholders to confirm whether we should move forward with Lee‚Äôs suggestion (sum of all anticipated PSE loads in the zone) or retain the current approach?

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

‚úÖ This version:

Reminds them what was agreed last time.

Points out the conflict (both fields using the same value).

Brings in Lee‚Äôs suggestion.

Clearly states the current approach vs. proposal.

Ends with a call-to-action (short call to finalize).


Do you also want me to prepare a 1-slide diagram (formula vs. proposed change) that you can show in the call, so it‚Äôs visually clear?

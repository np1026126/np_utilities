Subject: Request for QA Sign-Off – DC4.2 Friday Prod Release (No Regression Required)

Dear [QA Manager's Name],

As part of the upcoming DC4.2 production release scheduled for this Friday, I would like to highlight the following:

The 4 feature changes planned for this release were already part of the last sprint's UAT deployment. Regression testing was completed during that cycle, and no additional changes have been made to those components since.

For this release, we are only pushing 3 bug fixes, and corresponding changes are limited to just 3 modules. Relevant UAT images have been shared specifically for these fixes.


Given that the core features are already validated and no regression-impacting changes are introduced, we request QA validation only for the 3 bug fixes. Full regression is not required for this release.

Kindly confirm your agreement on proceeding with bug-level validation only.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Designation]
[Project/Team Name]

Let me know if you'd like this in a more casual tone or if the QA manager’s name should be added.

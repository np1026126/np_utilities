Here’s a professional way you can reply to Peter and Andres:


---

Peter / Andres — For Duff, Plainfield, and Westside, the UPS, PDUs, and RPPs are missing because the upstream data sources don’t have the necessary records. Specifically, PDUs are not present in CPNG, and RPPs are not available in IFP. Without the RPP data, we cannot generate the dependent PDUs and, in turn, the UPS associations. At present, there’s no source available to fill these gaps, which is why these assets are absent in the generated output.

Do you want me to also make a follow-up version that proposes a next step so it doesn’t sound like the discussion ends here? That way, it shows you’re proactive about solving it.

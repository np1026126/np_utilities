Perfect — your intent is clear, and this is a very reasonable and well-balanced ask 👍
You’re not pushing responsibility onto the site survey team, you’re just asking for validation + optional enrichment.

Below is a refined reply that keeps everything you liked from the earlier version and adds exactly these two points:

1. Ask Jamie to verify whether the provided values can be corroborated on site


2. Ask him to optionally share CRAC/CRAH details, so you can cross-check with users

Subject: RE: Cooling Zone & Sensible Capacity – New Berlin

> Hi Jamie,

Thanks for the follow-up — your question around cooling zones and CRACs is valid, so I wanted to clarify how we are handling this for New Berlin.

In DC Track, a Cooling Zone is captured at the room/area level, and the sensible capacity represents the total effective cooling available to that room, not an individual CRAC/CRAH unit.

For the New Berlin site, out of the 15 locations, the user-provided (LEI) data identified cooling zones for only 4 rooms. For those rooms, the users provided sensible capacity values in tons (200, 148, 2, and 1).

These values were provided directly by the users, and we have imported them as-is since no additional cooling zone data was available for the remaining rooms.

If possible, could you please check whether you are able to find or validate these sensible capacity values on site for those specific rooms? This will help us confirm alignment with what the users provided.

Additionally, if you have CRAC/CRAH details (unit counts, ratings, or nameplate data) available for any of these rooms, feel free to include them. We can review those details with the users and confirm whether any refinement or additional updates are needed.

Otherwise, we will proceed with the user-provided cooling zone values as the source of record.

Please let us know what you find.

Thanks,
Naveen

🔑 Why this wording works

✔ Clearly states users provided only partial data (4/15 rooms)

✔ Asks Jamie to verify, not calculate

✔ Keeps final authority with users

✔ Opens the door for CRAC enrichment, not requirement

✔ Avoids any blame or rework pressure

🧠 Optional one-liner (if he pushes back later)

You can use this if needed:

> “Cooling zone capacity was provided only where users had confidence in the data; remaining rooms were intentionally left blank.”

If you want, I can:

Make this even shorter

Convert it to a Slack-style response

Add a table of the 4 rooms + capacities you can attach


Just tell me 👍

> Hi Pete,

As part of our IFP to DC-Track migration, we are reviewing the AC power flow: from UPS to Floor PDU → Floor PDU to RPP → RPP to panels/breakers. However, we’ve noticed that in certain IFP sites, Floor PDU data is missing, while RPPs are present and mapped to downstream panels.

In such cases, to maintain the required hierarchy and successfully migrate RPPs to DC-Track (where a Floor PDU is mandatory), we’re considering treating the RPP itself as a Floor PDU (i.e., a local Floor PDU), and mapping its downstream panels accordingly.

Could you please confirm if this approach is acceptable from an architecture perspective? Or is there a recommended alternative for handling RPPs in sites without Floor PDUs?

Appreciate your input on this.

Would you like a version with less technical jargon, or is this the level you're comfortable with for management and tech discussions?

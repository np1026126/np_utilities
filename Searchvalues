Great question! For your AC Power Calculation feature, non-functional requirements (NFRs) are just as important as functional ones because they define quality attributes such as performance, usability, scalability, and reliability.

Below are tailored non-functional requirements specifically for the AC power calculation feature within your 1PSC planning system:

âœ… Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for AC Power Calculation

1. Performance

NFR-1: The system shall load and display the UPS-related fields and associated PDU/RPP data in the pop-up window within 2 seconds after selecting the plant type.

NFR-2: Load calculations in the Analysis section shall complete and render within 1 second after all dependencies (UPS/PDU/RPP values) are populated.

NFR-3: The dashboard must handle at least 100 concurrent users without impacting the calculation accuracy or UI responsiveness.


2. Accuracy & Calculation Integrity

NFR-4: All load calculations (UPS, PDU, RPP, AC Load, Generator Load) shall be accurate to at least 2 decimal places and reflect real-time updates on field changes.

NFR-5: The system shall validate and prevent data mismatch (e.g., AC load exceeding UPS capacity, or invalid amps/kW conversions) before saving.


3. Usability

NFR-6: UI

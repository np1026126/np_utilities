Subject: Re: SIT Regression Tickets Review

Hi Shivanand / Dhiwakar,

Thanks for highlighting the regression tickets.

Upon our review, we initially assumed the issue wasn’t related to VGA, as no one from our team had worked on the Cyrus modules. However, on further analysis, we identified that changes made during the Redis cache implementation on our side may have contributed to the issue.

This has now been fixed and is working fine in SAT. I’ll be sending it to the Test Station shortly.

To avoid such misses going forward, we will ensure a proper internal analysis is done from our end. If it's found not to be a VGA-related issue, we will reassign it to the appropriate team (e.g., TCS) accordingly.

Thanks for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
VGA Team

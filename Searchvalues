Perfect — now I clearly understand what you actually did practically:

✔ You uploaded the schema diagrams as images

✔ You also provided the table names + column names (from CPNG/IFP/FUSE)

✔ And you told Gemini to match DC-Track fields to the closest column

✔ And Gemini returned the mapping table.

Now you want the exact same practical prompt that recreates your real workflow:

👉 Schema Image + Table Structure (text) → DC-Track Mapping Table (CSV-like)

I will give you the BEST possible Gemini prompt that works exactly with images + table structures, and outputs a table identical to your Screenshot 1.

This prompt matches the real AI usage you did — not theoretical, but practical.

🎯 THE EXACT PRACTICAL GEMINI PROMPT FOR MAPPING WITH IMAGES

Copy–paste this into Gemini before uploading the images.

✅ GEMINI PROMPT (Realistic + Practical)

**“I am going to upload:

1. A screenshot of the DC-Track holistic template for an asset (this is the TARGET format).


2. One or more schema diagrams as images from the CPNG system.


3. A table containing the raw table names and column names from CPNG.



From these inputs, produce a mapping table in the EXACT format below:**

DC-TRACK Column Name | CPNG Table Name | CPNG Column Name | Mapped? (Yes/No)

Instructions for processing:

1. Read the DC-Track template screenshot and extract all field names from it.


2. Read the schema diagram images and understand the table relationships and column meanings.


3. Read the list of table names and columns that I provide separately.


4. For every DC-Track field:

Identify the closest matching table and column in the CPNG schema (using the images + text).

If the field does not exist in CPNG, mark Table = “N/A”, Column = “N/A”, Mapped = “No”.



5. Only choose a column if the meaning matches — do NOT guess incorrectly.


6. The output must be a clean mapping table with 4 columns exactly:

DC-Track Column

CPNG Table Name

CPNG Column Name

Mapped?



7. Format the output as a spreadsheet-like table that I can paste into Excel.



Wait for me to upload the images and table structures, and then start the mapping.”

🔥 WHY THIS PROMPT WORKS PERFECTLY

Because it tells Gemini:

✔ You will upload schema diagram images (your photos)

✔ You will upload a DC-Track template screenshot (yellow/orange)

✔ You will upload table name/column lists (text table)

✔ Gemini must combine all three inputs and output the mapping table.

This reflects exactly your real process.

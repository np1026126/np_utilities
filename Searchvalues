Perfect, I understand exactly what you want now 👍
You want ONE consolidated, single-sheet / single-document that combines all three earlier asks, starting from Rails Used & U-Position, and covering DC Plant (battery, discharge, runtime, load amps, etc.), Generator, ATS, UPS, PDU, RPP, Busway, Rectifier, Plant Panel, BDFB, Battery — with only what needs to be filled, and everything else clearly marked as not required.

Below is a clean, upload-ready “Single Source of Truth” document.
You can paste this into Google Docs / Word / Confluence / SharePoint as-is.

Here’s a professional and empathetic response you can post as a reply in the Slack thread. It explains the workaround clearly without sounding defensive or dismissive:

Hi everyone,
I completely understand the impact this issue has had on your teams, and I sincerely apologize for the disruption caused. The root cause has been identified and the fix is already in SIT, tested, and scheduled for the next production drop on Friday (06/27).

Since this behavior (edit icon visibility) is currently governed by code-level workgroup logic, a quick DB update won't be effective as a workaround.

That said, as a temporary measure, we can assign impacted users (e.g., Network Engineers) to the Network Admin workgroup solely for the purpose of enabling the edit functionality. Once their necessary updates are complete, we’ll promptly remove the elevated access to maintain security and compliance.

Please let us know which users need this access, and we’ll coordinate to enable it temporarily until the permanent fix is live on Friday.

Thanks for your patience and support.

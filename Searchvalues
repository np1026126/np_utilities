Here’s a refined version of your second clarification question that includes all the missing parts you mentioned and frames it cleanly for the users:

Draft Question to Users:

> I’d like to clarify the calculation of anticipated load across levels.

For example, in a given PSE, the anticipated load at the RPP panel is calculated as (equipment watts ÷ 1000). So, if 10 equipments together have 50 kW, that 50 is stored as the anticipated load of the RPP panel.

Now, if we look at the Total UPS Load formula, it is written as Anticipated Load (current PSE) + Previous Anticipated Load. My question is:

At the UPS or PDU level, should this “Anticipated Load” still be taken directly as (equipment watts ÷ 1000) for the same PSE (e.g., add the same 50 kW directly at UPS level)?

Or should we instead calculate anticipated load only at the RPP panel level and then roll it up — i.e.,

Sum of all RPP panels → RPP level anticipated load

Sum of all RPPs → PDU level anticipated load

Sum of all PDUs → UPS level anticipated load


Could you please confirm whether we are expected to propagate the same PSE anticipated load (e.g., 50 kW) upwards directly or whether it should only be aggregated step by step through RPP → PDU → UPS?

👉 Do you want me to also merge this with your first question (about the formulas for UPS, PDU, RPP loads) into one consolidated message so you can send them as a single clarification instead of splitting? That way the users will see the dependency more clearly.

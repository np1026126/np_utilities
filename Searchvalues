âœ… Detailed Process for DC-TRAC Asset Migration

Step No.	Step	Details

1	Receive Final Template	User shares the finalized holistic template with asset data for each site.
2	Make & Model Import	Extract all unique makes and models from the template. Ensure they are uploaded into DC-TRAC first (must be in system before asset upload).
3	Asset Import (UAT / PLE)	Begin asset import in sequence: Generators â†’ Panels â†’ Rectifiers â†’ Batteries â†’ Breakers, etc.
4	Fallout Capture	For any failed imports, capture fallouts in a structured table with the following: asset name, row no., error message, and failed column. Store this in a fallout tracking DB or sheet.
5	Fix & Reimport	Fix fallout errors and reimport the updated asset rows. Repeat this until all assets import cleanly.
6	Flow Validation	Confirm all relationships (power chain / source / location / parent-child links) are working end-to-end.
7	Ready for Production	Once UAT / PLE validations are successful, repeat the same import in production.

ðŸ§  Prompt to Use in Google Gemini:

> Iâ€™m working on a DC-TRAC data migration project. I have a list of assets from IFP, CP&G, and FUSE in structured holistic templates.

The process we follow is:

1. Receive user templates


2. Extract unique Make & Model and import them first into DC-TRAC


3. Then import the asset data one by one


4. If there are any import errors or fallout, capture them in a fallout tracking table (with asset name, row number, error message, etc.)


5. Fix the fallout and re-upload


6. Once clean, validate all power chain flows and relationships (UPS â†’ PDU â†’ RPP â†’ Breakers)


7. Finally, upload the same into production



Can you help generate a clear checklist or timeline tracker for these steps, including fields I should capture in the fallout tracker?

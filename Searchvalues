Certainly! Here's the exact prompt you can use in Google Gemini to generate the three new user stories based on your described continuation features.

✅ Prompt for Google Gemini:

> Create three detailed Agile user stories for the following use case in a system called 1PSC:

Context:
Users can add or update SNMP OIDs and IP addresses for assets like DC plants. Based on this, UCS (a third-party system) pulls real-time data like current and voltage using the configured SNMP OID and IP address.

The following new features need to be implemented:


---

Story 1: UI Validation and Sync Status Field

In the 1PSC frontend, the UI must validate the entered SNMP OID and IP address formats before submission.

A new field called “UCS Sync Status” should be added in the UI.

The status can be: In Progress, Not Synced, or Synced.

When a new OID or IP is added or changed, the status should be automatically set to “In Progress.”



---

Story 2: Backend API to Check UCS Pulling Activity

A backend API should be developed that checks whether UCS has started pulling data for the given SNMP OID and IP address.

It should compare from the date the new values were updated and look for any data received via Kafka (or UCS topic).

If data is found for the new OID/IP, it updates the sync status to “Synced.”

If not, the status remains as “In Progress” or “Not Synced.”



---

Story 3: Email Notification on First Pull Detection

When the system detects that UCS has successfully started pulling data for a newly updated IP address or OID, it should send an email notification.

The email should be sent to the user who made the update.

The email should include: asset name, IP address, SNMP OID, location, and confirmation that polling has started.

This serves as confirmation that the update has taken effect.

For each story, provide:

A Title

A Summary

A detailed Description

Acceptance Criteria in bullet format

Let me know if you want me to go ahead and write out all three stories for you here, based on this prompt.

Got it 👍
Below is a single, clean, professional mail you can send to users. It:
Clearly reflects Sunbird’s final recommendation (Remote Panels + mirroring works)
Explains the breaker assignment impact from IFP (Panel A / Panel B mapping)
Asks for explicit confirmation
Politely reminds them about the other open questions, respecting their time
Mentions that work is currently in PLE

Confirmation Needed: Remote Power Panel Approach & Breaker Mapping for NEC Migration
Hi Team,
Following up on the discussion and the ticket raised with Sunbird, we have received clarification from their architects and wanted to align with you on the next steps.
Sunbird’s Recommendation
Instead of Local Power Panels, Sunbird recommends using Remote Power Panels under the RPPs.
With Remote Power Panels:
Panels can have different / unique names
Mirroring is still supported
There is no functional change in behavior
The only difference is in the one-line diagram, where Remote Panels will appear slightly below / outside the RPP (Floor PDU) boundary. Sunbird confirmed this is a visual placement difference only.
Impact on Breaker Assignment (IFP → DCPAC)
One important point we want to confirm with you:
In IFP, breaker assignments currently reference panels generically as Panel A / Panel B
If we proceed with Remote Panels using the user-provided panel names:
We will need to map IFP Panel A / Panel B to the corresponding named panels
This mapping will need to be consistently maintained for:
Initial migration
Any future updates or changes
Please confirm if this approach is acceptable from your side.
Confirmation Requested
Could you please confirm if we can proceed with:
Using Remote Power Panels under RPPs
Retaining user-provided panel names
Accepting the minor one-line diagram placement difference
Mapping IFP Panel A / Panel B to the corresponding named panels for breaker assignments and future updates
Once confirmed, we’ll proceed accordingly.
Other Open Items
We had also shared a few additional questions earlier (six in total). We understand you may be tied up with other priorities, but whenever you get time, your inputs on the remaining points would really help us move forward smoothly.
If the required data or clarification is available, it will allow us to address those items in parallel.
For now, the work is progressing in PLE, and your confirmation on the above will help us plan the next steps for the migration.
Thanks,
Naveen

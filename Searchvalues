Thanks! Based on your points, here is a polished version for the fourth goal (Innovation and Organization Initiatives):

Description:

Innovation and Efficiency Improvements:

Took the initiative to incorporate AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini in day-to-day development workflows. These tools are being used to:

Automate code generation and validation during story development.

Assist in faster and accurate migrations, especially for data mapping and transformation logic.

Reduce manual effort in code review and help maintain consistency across modules.


As part of our team's broader innovation culture, actively participated in a recent Hackathon, exploring how AI-based automation can significantly reduce repetitive and deep-rooted manual work — a concept that received positive feedback from leadership.

Additionally, I have been brainstorming ideas to reduce bug occurrences proactively, particularly those related to regression and missed validations. While these ideas are currently in the conceptual stage, I plan to implement them soon to further support quality assurance and business stability.


These initiatives reflect my commitment to continuous improvement, both in how we work and in the outcomes we deliver to the business.

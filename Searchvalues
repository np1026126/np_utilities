Hi Team,

As part of the testing, we have identified four issues:

1. The anticipated load for the selected location on the RPP is not being displayed.


2. The edit functionality for the anticipated load is not working.


3. The values are not being populated correctly for the selected location on the RPP.


4. [Include the fourth issue here if you missed mentioning it earlier.]



Requesting the team to review and address these issues. Will keep you posted on further findings.

Thanks,
Naveen

If you want, I can make this reply shorter and in the same tone as the existing chat messages so it blends naturally. Do you want me to do that?

We have now applied a temporary workaround by manually populating the data through scripts. This has resolved the issue for the time being, and the update functionality should now be working as expected.

Please go ahead and validate from your end. Do let us know if you observe any further issues.

We will keep you informed about the permanent fix, which is currently planned for promotion on 05/15, if required.

Thanks,
Naveen Prasad

Additionally, please note that as part of this production deployment, we have already included the long-term fix for the broken behavior observed in the last release. This fix has been successfully tested in Unity and is ready for deployment. However, for this fix to be pushed to production, the UNO UI performance issue must be resolved.

We had assured users that this long-term solution would be delivered in this release, and once deployed, we will revert the temporary workaround (where all network engineers were assigned as network engineer managers). Therefore, resolving the performance issue is critical not only for system efficiency but also to honor the commitment made to users.

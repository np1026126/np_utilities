🎯 FINAL GEMINI PROMPT FOR CREATING THE PPT (Copy–Paste This to Gemini)


---

👉 Paste the text below into Gemini:


---

Create a professional PowerPoint presentation for a 3–5 minute video explanation about how we migrated Wireless Network Assets from three legacy systems — IFP, CPNG, and FUSE — into DC-Track using AI (Google Gemini + GitHub Copilot).

Important Instructions:

1. I am going to upload around 10–15 images next

IFP schema diagrams

CPNG schema diagrams

FUSE schema diagrams

Holistic templates (DC-Track format)

Mapping sheets (IFP/CPNG/FUSE → DCTrack mapping)

Data model diagrams


Place each image in the appropriate slide based on the topics below.


2. Make the PPT senior-leadership friendly

High level

No heavy text

Clear storytelling

Visual first

Bullets only, 3–4 per slide



3. Use a consistent clean theme

White background

Blue & black text

Minimalistic professional style

Mapping sheet screenshot
Bullets:

DC-Track → IFP fields

DC-Track → CPNG fields

DC-Track → FUSE fields

Produced complete mapping tables



---

Slide 8 — Step 4: SQL Query Generation Using Copilot

Title: Step 4: SQL Query Automation (Copilot)
Bullets:

Generated SQL joins automatically

Consistent logic across 3 databases

Faster extraction with fewer errors

Slide 11 — Outcomes

Title: Outcomes
Bullets:

80–90% reduction in manual effort

Accurate multi-system mapping

Faster migration execution

Reusable AI-based framework



---

Slide 12 — Closing Slide

Title: Conclusion
Text:
“AI transformed complex, unstructured multi-system data into a clean, DC-Track-ready model, enabling fast, scalable wireless migration.”


---

Final Instructions

Insert all the images EXACTLY where they logically fit.

Resize and crop the schema pictures cleanly for readability.

Add speaker notes per slide with a simple narration (I will provide separately if needed).

Export as PPTX.

🎯 WHAT THIS PROMPT WILL DO

When you paste this into Gemini and upload all your schema/mapping screenshots:

Gemini will automatically:

✔ Create the PPT
✔ Place all your images
✔ Apply proper slide titles
✔ Follow your migration story
✔ Make it ready for your video


---

🔥 If you want next:

I can also give you:

✅ Gemini prompt to create speaker notes

✅ Gemini prompt to create demo videos

✅ Gemini prompt to generate the SQL/mapping examples

✅ A full video narration script for 5 minutes

Just say:
👉 “Give me the speaker notes prompt too”

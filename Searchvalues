Great! Here's a polished version of your Slack reply, combining both points:

Hi Jonathan,
Yes, your understanding is absolutely correct. We are now moving forward with the updated approach—creating 4 separate local panels, each containing one 600A breaker, instead of a single panel housing 4 breakers. Each breaker will independently feed one RPP, as discussed and aligned with James and Andrew.

I’ll make the necessary changes to the WINDSOR sheet based on this updated approach by the end of today and will keep you posted once the sheet is updated.

Let me know if you'd like to add anything about the supplemental sheets or training video they mentioned.

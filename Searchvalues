Current Issue:
In Address Lookup, since the address is provided by the user and we only validate it against LOCUS, we are not cross-verifying that address with SILLYNet (the address spotter). We already have a feature in the backlog to cross-check all addresses from other owning systems. When a difference is found in the address, it will be flagged and displayed separately.

Perfect — I see what you have.

Let’s tell Copilot exactly what’s in each sheet and what join we want. You can copy–paste this as is (just change sheet names if yours are slightly different).

Prompt for Copilot (Excel):

> I have two sheets in this workbook.
Sheet 1 is named "RPP_UNKNOWN" and has these columns:

A: Name → this is the RPP name

B: Location → this is the RPP location (format like “ALPRGAGQ > SWITCH ROOM C 304”).


Sheet 2 is named "PDU_relationship" and has these columns:

C: Item Name → this is the PDU name

D: Item Location → this is the PDU location

F: Related Item Name → this is the RPP name that the PDU is connected to

G: Related Item Location → this is the RPP location


I want to match every RPP in “RPP_UNKNOWN” with its PDUs from “PDU_relationship”.
Join condition:

RPP_UNKNOWN.Name = PDU_relationship.[Related Item Name]

and RPP_UNKNOWN.Location = PDU_relationship.[Related Item Location]


Give me a new table with these columns:

1. RPP Name


2. RPP Location


3. PDU Name (from Item Name)


4. PDU Location (from Item Location)



If an RPP in “RPP_UNKNOWN” does not have any matching PDU in “PDU_relationship”, still show the RPP and mark PDU Name / PDU Location as “Not mapped”.

Generate this as an Excel solution (either Power Query/M or a formula-based approach). Also explain the steps.

If your second sheet has slightly different column letters, just adjust C/D/F/G in the prompt — logic stays the same: match RPP name + RPP location → pull PDU name + PDU location.

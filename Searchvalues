Perfect 👍 You’re basically ready to build a step-by-step PPT outline that tells a story of:

1. What the old process was


2. What the challenges are


3. What the proposed new process is


4. How the load calculation flows bottom-up



Here’s a detailed presentation flow you can use in Google Gemini (or PowerPoint) and then edit as needed:

📑 PPT Outline – Anticipated Load Flow in DCTrack

Slide 1 – Title

“Proposed Approach: Anticipated Load Calculation in DCTrack”

Subtitle: Migrating from UPS selection to RPP-centric flow



---

Slide 2 – Background

Current process is UPS-centric → users must select UPS → PDU → RPP → RPP Panel.

Users don’t know which UPS/PDU to select → confusion & complexity.

Goal: simplify process by letting users select directly at RPP level.



---

Slide 3 – Before Approach (Current Process)

User selects UPS at location.

From UPS → fetch connected PDU.

From PDU → fetch connected RPPs.

From RPP → fetch connected RPP Panels.

Equipment mapped manually through this chain.
(Use a simple flow diagram here: UPS → PDU → RPP → RPP Panel → Equipment)



---

Slide 4 – Challenges in Current Process

End-users don’t know UPS/PDU details.

Multiple clicks and selections required.

Higher chance of wrong mapping.

Load roll-up not always automatic; requires manual aggregation.



---

Slide 5 – Proposed Approach (New Flow)

User directly selects RPP (or RPP Panel).

Application hits DCTrack API to fetch:

PDU connected to RPP

UPS Bank connected to PDU


UPS Bank becomes calculation level (instead of single UPS).
(Use a flow diagram: RPP → API → PDU + UPS Bank → Calculation)



---

Slide 6 – Anticipated Load Handling

Anticipated load stored in custom field at RPP Panel.

New Anticipated Load = Current Load (sum of cabinet reserve power) + New Anticipated Load (e.g., 50A).

Current Load is derived from:

Cabinets migrated from CND into DCTrack.

Dummy device created with actual cabinet power rating.


Anticipated load stays active until In-Service Date = 0.



---

Slide 7 – Load Propagation (Bottom-Up Calculation)

At RPP Panel: add new anticipated load.

At RPP: sum all connected RPP Panels’ anticipated loads.

At PDU: sum all connected RPPs’ anticipated loads.

At UPS Bank: sum all connected PDUs’ anticipated loads.
(Show as a pyramid diagram: Panel → RPP → PDU → UPS Bank)



---

Slide 8 – Role of Sunbird Rules

Request Sunbird team to automate roll-up rules:

Whatever value added at Panel auto-propagates upwards.

No need for manual summation at each level.


If not available, fallback approach:

Application will manually compute sums and update DCTrack.




---

Slide 9 – Benefits of Proposed Approach

Simplified user selection (only at RPP).

Accurate calculation at UPS Bank level.

Seamless propagation of anticipated loads.

Better capacity planning and utilization visibility.



---

Slide 10 – Next Steps

Validate flow with Sunbird team.

Implement API integrations.

Test load roll-up accuracy.

Deploy updated workflow for users.



---

⚡ Pro-tip: Add flow diagrams and tables at key slides (Before vs After, and Load Roll-Up Pyramid). Visuals will make it 10x clearer.

Would you like me to make a draft PPT with these slides (content filled in + sample visuals/diagrams) so you can directly upload into Google Gemini and refine?

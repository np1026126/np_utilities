Based on everything you've provided â€” the chat history, your spoken notes, screenshots, and the Sunbird ticket-related email â€” here is a professionally written bullet-point summary that you can send to your manager as a daily update after the IFP migration call on 24th July 2025:

âœ… IFP Migration Update â€“ 24th July 2025

Users started with validation of AC flow structures. As UPS values were not present in CPNG, they provided a one-line diagram with KW/KVA ratings per UPS.

Based on the values shared, we created the UPS, UPS Bank, Load Devices, Floor PDU, and RPP entries to simulate the correct power chain in DCTrack.

Initially, we treated RPP as a Floor PDU (to align with IFP structure) and created a panel inside the RPP, fed from the Floor PDU. Scripts were developed accordingly.

However, upon reviewing the one-line diagram in todayâ€™s call, users were not satisfied with the representation of RPP with panels inside a floor PDU.

With support from Sunbird, we proposed a new structure:
âž¤ Instead of having one RPP with two panels, we will now create two separate RPPs, each holding one panel.
âž¤ This revised approach is more aligned with user expectations.

The updated diagram based on this approach was accepted by the users.

Users requested that for now, this updated logic should be implemented at least for Windsor, post which theyâ€™ll review how the data appears in DCTrack.

Required changes to scripts were acknowledged, especially for the floor PDU and panel sections, and updates will be made accordingly.

ðŸ”§ Template & System Limitations Raised

The following system limitations were discussed and are to be submitted as Sunbird support tickets:

1. Room Mapping Limitation:
âž¤ The current upload template does not allow mapping RPP to a different room than its associated PDU.
âž¤ Manual intervention via DCTrack UI is needed after upload.
âž¤ Requesting enhancement to support RPP and PDU room assignment independently during template upload.


2. Bulk Room Editing:
âž¤ DCTrack currently lacks the option to bulk edit items/room assignments post-upload.
âž¤ Users requested this functionality to streamline location updates.


3. Missing KVA/KW at PDU Level:
âž¤ Real-time tracking of PDU KW/KVA (phase-wise) values is missing.
âž¤ Users emphasized this is essential for managing PDU utilization.
âž¤ Until then, this may be handled by defining custom fields.

ðŸ“Œ Additional Points

For sites where UPS values are missing (not available in CPNG), users must provide the required KW/KVA inputs.

In a few cases, PDU data is completely missing â€” users must provide this for us to complete the AC power flow mapping.

These inputs are mandatory for proceeding with the AC power flow implementation across other locations.

Subject: Windsor Site – Regenerated Holistic Template with Updated Asset Details and Instructions

Dear Team,

As part of the SAP site updates and in response to the recent Slack discussion, please find the regenerated Holistic Template for the Windsor site attached via Google Sheets.

This template consolidates and reflects updates across multiple asset categories and serves as a reference for validation and completion.

✅ Deliverables Summary

1. Holistic Template Regenerated for Windsor
A comprehensive Google Sheet has been created with five tabs capturing all required assets:

Tab 1 – Floor PDU (Panel 1)

Tab 2 – PDU Panel Breakers

Tab 3 – UPS

Tab 4 – HVAC

Tab 5 – Instructions



2. Updated Asset Data (Tabs 1 to 4)
The following data has been reviewed and populated for Windsor:

Floor PDU

Panel

Breaker

UPS

HVAC


These values were aligned as per the expected naming conventions, position sequencing, and required mapping logic.


3. Color-Coded Columns for Verification
All fields that require user verification or modification have been highlighted in red across the sheets.
This will help the team easily identify areas that need action or confirmation.


4. Detailed Instruction Tab (Tab 5)
A dedicated ‘Instructions’ tab is included to:

Outline changes made

Specify user actions required for each asset type

Clarify applied logic (e.g., panel renaming, pole sequencing, object type changes)

We are actively working on updating the full SAP site dataset.
This will be delivered as a separate file by EOD tomorrow (30th July 2025).

📌 Additional Notes:

Kindly validate the highlighted fields and update in the same sheet if there is any change to the values.

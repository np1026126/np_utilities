Description:

Effective Communication & Cross-Team Collaboration:

Demonstrated strong and clear communication with peers, vendor partners, and end users by consistently articulating issues, solutions, and flows in a way that is well received and understood by diverse audiences:

Communicated clearly and confidently with internal team members by explaining story logic, fix points, and flows. For example, while working with Manasa and Subiksha, I provided hands-on guidance and clarity on where code changes need to be made and how stories can be completed efficiently.

Extended that communication to vendor teams (TCS, Product, and AOS) by:

Explaining detailed RCA for production defects.

Guiding them on how to fix the issues and where to focus their changes, enabling faster and more accurate resolution.

Providing direction on task assignments and tracking their progress in regular sync-ups like BSU calls.


Engaged directly with end users, especially in scenarios involving bugs or unexpected behaviors. I provided clear explanations and context to users, helping them understand the issue and accept the provided workaround or solution.

Though I haven’t formally participated in KPI forums, I have built positive and result-oriented collaborations with various stakeholders. My ability to communicate effectively has helped increase cross-team success rates, reduce rework, and build confidence in delivery cycles across both product and vendor teams.


These efforts reflect my ability to communicate with clarity, earn trust, and drive alignment, ensuring all stakeholders — technical and non-technical — are on the same page.

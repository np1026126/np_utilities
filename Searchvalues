Sure!
I will write a clean, easy-to-read narration script for the first two slides based on your notes in the image.
You can simply scroll and read during your recording.

🎤 Narration Script for Slide 1 & Slide 2


---

👉 Slide 1 — “AI-Driven Wireless Migration”

Speak:

“Hi everyone, this is Naveen.
In this presentation, I’ll walk through how we used AI tools to accelerate our wireless network migration from IFP, CPNG, and ITUS systems into DC-Track.

Basically, I’ll explain how AI reduced manual effort, standardized our process, and helped our team handle three different systems efficiently.”


---

👉 Slide 2 — “Migration Challenge”

Speak:

“The data available to us from the three legacy systems was completely unstructured.
Due to inconsistency and lack of data standards, each system had different column names, different table structures, and different ways of storing the same assets.

This made manual mapping highly time-consuming.
We had difficulties comparing three different schemas, identifying fields, and creating a standard power-chain hierarchy.”


---

If you want, I can also prepare the narration for Slide 3 and onwards, in the same simple, professional style.

“In IFUPC, all assets are dumped into a single EDU table without clear separation or hierarchy — there are no defined parent-child relationships, no standardized asset types, and no consistent power-chain mapping. That is why we call it unstructured.”

⭐ Point 3 — IFUPC Data Was Unstructured (Short & Crisp)

Speak:
“In IFUPC, all asset types were stored together in a single EDU table without any hierarchy or classification.
There were no standard parent–child mappings or defined power-chain relationships.
This unstructured format made it difficult to extract clean, mapped data — which is exactly where the AI prompt helped us.”


---

This version is short, to the point, and directly sets up the next section where you will explain:

what prompt you used,

how AI interpreted the unstructured EDU data,

how it generated structured output for migration.


If you want, I can also write the transition sentence that connects this point to your AI prompt explanation.
1. Creating DC-Track Holistic Templates

Speak:

“Our first step was to create the DC-Track holistic templates for every asset.
These templates define the exact columns, formats, and fields required by DC-Track.
This becomes our target model for the migration.

I’ll quickly show the holistic templates we created in Google Sheets for each asset category.
This defines what DC-Track expects from us.”


---

2. Collecting All Source System Schemas

Speak:

“The next step was to extract the table schemas from each source system — IFP, CPNG, and ITUS.
I collected all the schema diagrams, all the table names, and all the column names from these systems.
These represent our source models.”


---

3. Feeding Templates + Schemas into Gemini

Speak:

“Once I had both the DC-Track templates and the source schemas, I uploaded everything into Google Gemini.
I gave Gemini:

the holistic template of the target DC-Track asset,

the schema diagrams or table structures from IFP, CPNG, and ITUS,

and then I used a prompt to ask Gemini to map the DC-Track columns to the correct table and column names from each source system.”



---

4. The Prompt That Generates the Mapping

Speak:

“The prompt I used basically told Gemini:

‘Here is the DC-Track template.
Here are the IFP, CPNG, and ITUS schemas.
Based on the template column names and the schema structures, give me the mapping of each DC-Track column to the correct source table and column.’”


---

5. Mapping Output Generated by Gemini

Speak:

“This is the output that Gemini produced — a complete mapping sheet.
For each DC-Track column, it tells me:

which IFP table/column it maps to,

which CPNG table/column it maps to,

and which ITUS table/column it maps to.


This mapping is generated automatically by the prompt based on the template and schema that I provided.

I am showing the CSV output here — for example, this column is the DC-Track column name, and these columns show the corresponding field from CPNG, IFP, or ITUS.”


---

6. Repeat for Every Asset

Speak:

“We followed this same approach for every asset type — UPS, rectifiers, HVAC, fuse panels, DC panels, BDFBs, and so on.
For each asset, we:

created a DC-Track holistic template,

collected schema from IFP/CPNG/ITUS,

fed them into Gemini,

and received the complete mapping table.


This mapping becomes the foundation for transforming the raw source-system data into the DC-Track format.”


---

✔ Very Short Version (if you need a 1-minute summary)

“We first built DC-Track templates for every asset.
Then we collected schemas from IFP, CPNG, and ITUS.
We fed both the templates and the schemas into Gemini.
Using a custom prompt, Gemini generated a complete mapping of DC-Track columns to the correct tables and fields in all three source systems.
We repeated this process for each asset to get a full mapping library for the migration.”

If you want, I can also write your next slide narration — where you show the prompt itself and explain it line by line.

Hereâ€™s a polished way to frame your question to the users based on the two screenshots and your observation:

Draft Question to Users:

In the current DC flow, the anticipated load is calculated in Amps as:

\text{Anticipated Load (A)} = \frac{\text{Equipment Watts}}{\text{Selected Power Plant Float Voltage}}

At the same time, the system also provides an anticipated watts value, which is derived as:

\text{Anticipated Watts} = (\text{Sum of Max Heat in kW}) \times 1000

This approach ensures we have both anticipated load in Amps and anticipated watts in Watts.

However, in the proposed AC flow, the formula being used for anticipated load is:

\text{Anticipated Load (kW)} = \frac{\text{Total Equipment Watts}}{1000}

This already gives us the anticipated load in kW, which seems very close to the anticipated watts calculation (since anticipated watts Ã· 1000 = kW).

ðŸ‘‰ My clarification point:
Should we continue calculating anticipated watts separately in Watts for AC flow, the same way we do in DC, or should we consider the anticipated load (kW) calculation sufficient, and avoid duplicating the same value in two different units?

This wording highlights:

How DC does it (Amps + Watts)

How AC is proposed (only kW)

The overlap/doubt (are we double-counting the same thing?)

The direct question (should AC also have anticipated watts in Watts, or just stick to kW).


Would you like me to now combine this with your previous 3 questions (UPS load formula, anticipated load roll-up, UPS Bank vs UPS) into a single consolidated email draft so you can send it all at once instead of piecemeal?

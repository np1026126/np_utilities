Got it 👍
You want a VERY GOOD, STRUCTURED PROMPT for Google Gemini, so that:
Input = raw text from Copilot (logs + analysis for 12 in-progress PSEs)
Output = short, crisp insights
Categorize 12 PSEs into 4–5 clear buckets
Give summary + recommendations
Avoid long, verbose answers
Below is a COPY-PASTE READY PROMPT you can directly use in Google Gemini.
✅ BEST PROMPT FOR GOOGLE GEMINI (INSIGHTS + RECOMMENDATIONS)
I am uploading a text file that contains:
Analysis generated by Copilot
Log details for 12 in-progress PSEs
Actions performed, decisions taken, and current blockers for each PSE
Task:
Read the provided content and identify the reason why each of the 12 PSEs is still in progress.
Based on the logs and actions, group the 12 PSEs into 4–5 meaningful categories (for example: waiting for requester, data missing, technical dependency, approval pending, site issue, etc.).
Create a summary table with:
Category name
PSE count
PSE IDs (or brief reference)
One-line reason
After the table, provide:
Key Insights (max 5 bullet points, very short)
Actionable Recommendations (max 5 bullet points, focused on how to move PSEs to completion)
Important instructions:
Keep the output concise and manager-friendly
Do not repeat raw log text
Avoid long explanations
Focus on patterns, root causes, and next steps
Use clear headings
The final output should be suitable for:
Slack update
Email summary
Management review
🔹 OPTIONAL FOLLOW-UP PROMPT (If Gemini gives too much text)
If Gemini still gives a long answer, immediately send this:
Please compress the output further:
Limit categories to maximum 4
Insights to 3 bullets
Recommendations to 3 bullets
Keep everything within one screen length
✅ WHAT YOU WILL GET (EXPECTED OUTPUT STRUCTURE)

🎯 WHY THIS PROMPT WORKS
Clearly tells Gemini what to ignore (raw logs)
Forces pattern-based grouping
Caps verbosity
Produces ready-to-share output
If you want, next I can:
Rewrite this prompt specifically for Slack-ready output
Create a 1-slide PPT summary
Convert this into a standard template you can reuse every month

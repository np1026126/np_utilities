Subject: One-Time Load Sheet Ready for Production Upload

Hi [Counterpart’s Name],

I wanted to inform you that the one-time load sheet for calculations is ready to be uploaded into production. I’m currently performing the final validation checks to ensure the data is accurate.

Once you’re available, please let me know so that we can proceed with uploading the sheet into the production environment together.

You can access the sheet using the link below:

Thanks,

Would you like me to tailor it a bit more formally (for senior stakeholders) or keep it conversational for a peer-level counterpart?Give me a new table with these columns:

1. RPP Name


2. RPP Location


3. PDU Name (from Item Name)


4. PDU Location (from Item Location)



If an RPP in “RPP_UNKNOWN” does not have any matching PDU in “PDU_relationship”, still show the RPP and mark PDU Name / PDU Location as “Not mapped”.

Generate this as an Excel solution (either Power Query/M or a formula-based approach). Also explain the steps.

If your second sheet has slightly different column letters, just adjust C/D/F/G in the prompt — logic stays the same: match RPP name + RPP location → pull PDU name + PDU location.

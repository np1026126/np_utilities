Got it 👍 — here’s a refined, professional summary with your adjustments built in. I’ve reworded it so that the PDU panels point is framed as a question, replaced the Load Devices point with your “maintain the power chain” explanation, and expanded the clarification on panel → breaker details.

Draft Summary / Mail Content

We have reviewed the data provided for the 8 NEC sites, and here are the key observations and questions:

1. Assets Included

Each site contains mostly 4 standard assets.

Two locations also include a Busway as an additional asset.

One location includes a Transformer as an additional asset.

No DC power assets (plant, battery, etc.) were found in the current data.



2. PDU Panels

Panels are mapped at the PDU level, which I understand are primarily used to connect RPPs — can you confirm if this understanding is correct?

For each PDU panel, should we be creating a corresponding breaker in order to connect to the RPP?



3. Maintaining the Power Chain

Based on the current dataset, in order to maintain the power chain and ensure that values flow correctly across the hierarchy, we would need to ensure the PDU → Panel → Breaker → RPP linkage is modeled properly.

Without this, downstream calculations (anticipated load, utilization, etc.) may not flow back up to the PDU and UPS bank levels.



4. Clarification on Breaker Details

Currently, panel → breaker connections are not listed in the dataset.

Should we be sourcing the panel breaker details from IFP (in which case we would prepare a script to extract and process them), or will your team be providing these breaker details directly for the NEC sites?

This clarification is important for us to proceed correctly, as the breaker layer is required to complete the PDU-to-RPP mapping in DC Track.


Got it 👍 — here’s the final polished version of that third point with the script addition included:

3. Maintaining the Power Chain

Based on the current dataset, in order to maintain the power chain and ensure that values flow correctly across the hierarchy, we need to establish the following connections:

UPS → UPS Bank through a load device.

UPS Bank → PDU through a load device.

PDU → RPP through the associated panel breakers.


These connections need to be modeled so that downstream calculations (e.g., anticipated load, utilization, etc.) can correctly roll up from the panel breakers at the RPP level through the PDU and ultimately to the UPS bank in the DC Track UI.

To facilitate this, we will be creating a script to populate this data automatically so that the hierarchy and flows are consistent across all sites.

Do you want me to merge this refined point into the full four-point summary email draft I wrote earlier, so you can send it as one consolidated message to the Sunbird team?

👉 This way, you are not just reporting observations but also asking direct, professional questions on the missing breaker layer.

Do you want me to also expand this into a formal email template (with subject line and closing) so you can directly send it to the Sunbird team?

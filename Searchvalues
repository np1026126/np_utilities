Got it. You’re 100% right to push back on this, and your reasoning is technically, contractually, and operationally sound. Let me help you frame this clearly—both in logic and in words you can send back to Sunbird.
Core reality (very important)
This is NOT an application feature
This is NOT a customer customization
This is NOT an API misuse
👉 This is a vendor-introduced schema change in DC Track.
Sunbird:
Introduced a new standard field: Float Voltage
Renamed an existing customer-used custom field to PICustomField-19
Did not migrate existing data automatically
Broke downstream consumers (your APIs & calculations)
That makes this a product migration responsibility, not a customer task.
Why this is NOT your responsibility (clear bullets)
1. Vendor changed the data model
You did not rename the field
You did not introduce the conflict
You did not deprecate the custom field
➡️ Sunbird did.
Any data migration caused by vendor schema evolution must be handled by the vendor.
2. Asking customers to write schedules is unacceptable
What they’re asking you to do:
Write a scheduler
Read deprecated custom fields
Populate new standard fields
Maintain it across releases
This is:
❌ Custom development
❌ Billable contractor effort
❌ Reimplementation of core DC Track logic
A platform upgrade must not require customer-side data repair jobs.
3. Excel export/import is risky and not enterprise-grade
Their fallback suggestion is even worse:
Manual export
Manual import
Risk of:
Partial failures
Data type mismatches
Referential integrity issues
Audit & compliance gaps
This is not acceptable for production DCIM systems, especially for voltage values used in calculations.
4. Data already exists → migration is deterministic
Key point you should emphasize:
The values already exist in DC Track.
This is a 1:1 field migration, not a transformation.
So:
No business logic required
No user input required
No customer validation required
Which makes this ideal for a vendor-side migration script.
The strongest position you can take
Here’s the principle statement you should stand on:
Any backward-incompatible schema change introduced by Sunbird must include an automated migration of existing customer data as part of the release or patch.
This is industry standard (Salesforce, ServiceNow, SAP, Oracle — all do this).
What I would say to Sunbird (you can copy-paste & tweak)
Firm but professional response
The introduction of a new standard Float Voltage field and the renaming of our existing custom field was a platform-level change introduced by DC Track.
Since the data already exists within DC Track and this change originated from the product side, the responsibility to migrate existing values from the deprecated custom field to the new standard field should be handled by Sunbird as part of the release or a patch.
Asking customers to:
build custom schedulers, or
perform manual export/import activities
introduces operational risk, additional cost, and potential data integrity issues, especially for values actively used in calculations.
This is a deterministic, one-time migration with no business logic dependency and is best handled within the DC Track platform to ensure consistency across customers.
We would request Sunbird to provide an automated migration as part of the product upgrade rather than pushing this responsibility to individual customers.
If they still resist (escalation angle)
If needed, escalate with this line:
If this migration is left to customers, it effectively turns a mandatory platform upgrade into a paid customization effort, which is not acceptable for a standard product evolution.
That sentence usually gets attention.
Bottom line (for you internally)
You are not being unreasonable
You are protecting your project, cost, and risk
This is a Sunbird product gap, not a Verizon issue
You should not assign this to contractors
If you want, I can:
Rewrite this as a short executive escalation
Make a one-page risk assessment
Help you phrase this for a call with Sunbird leadership
Just tell me 👍

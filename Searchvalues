Thanks for the update and for keeping me informed, Andres.

Noted on the revised instructions shared with the site users. From our side, the supplemental sheets were generated using the limited data available from the IFP and CPNG databases. Specifically, the UPS names were derived based on the PDU naming logic, as UPS-specific data was not available in the CPNG DB either.

Additionally, for many of the SAP sites, PDU data itself was missing in the source systems. In those cases, we created PDU entries based on the available RPP names from IFP. However, even those mappings had inconsistencies due to missing or improperly structured records in the source data.

Given these constraints, we’ve done our best to structure the sheets, trusting the site teams to validate and correct the data using single line diagrams and on-ground knowledge. Please let me know if there’s any further action needed from our end.

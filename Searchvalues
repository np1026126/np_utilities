Subject: AOS Production Escalated Tickets – Summary and Current Status

Hi Team,

Please find below the summary of the escalated and auto-escalated AOS Production tickets, along with their current status and ownership details:

1. INC014190128 – Escalated 21 days ago (Urgent ticket issued on 3/21/2025)
Issue: PSC workgroups need to be removed for the listed users.
Status: This ticket is currently with the NPP team and is planned to be delivered as part of the next production release (not the coming Friday, but the following one).


2. INC014058798 – Auto-escalated for 20 days
Issue: Label change needed from PSC Capacity Manager to PSC Network Engineer in DC Track reports.
Status: Meghana has created a ticket to DC Track for this, and we will be following up to ensure the fix is implemented.


3. INC014250097 – Auto-escalated for 5 days
Issue 1: Correction needed in the type value under Product Line data.
Status: A script is being written to address this issue, and the fix is targeted for this Friday’s production release.
Issue 2: Product line currently shows only 295 lines instead of 321.
Clarification: This is not an issue. As per the defined logic, category, type, and size must form a unique combination for each product line. For the 26 records in question, this uniqueness was not maintained due to duplication, and hence they were excluded as expected.



Let us know if the escalation report is auto-generated from AYS. If not, we may need to review the data source and logic behind the report.

Thanks,

Here’s your updated Slack message with the additional Busway and RPP details included, still keeping it professional and clear:

Hi Team,

While creating cooling units, I’ve noticed that in some cases the HVAC zones are created automatically, but in other cases they are not. Additionally, for a few assets (including generators), creation is failing with a generic error message, and I’m unable to pinpoint the exact cause from the data available.

In certain cases, there are no RPPs, and only a Busway is present. I need clarity on how a Busway can be created as a floor PDU, how it can be connected to a floor PDU, and how breakers can be connected to it. I also need some guidance on Busway and tab box creation as part of the migration.

Could we set up a 30-minute working session to go through these issues together and identify the root cause? Please let me know your availability so we can get this scheduled.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

If you’d like, I can also make a bullet-point version so it’s even easier for them to read and respond quickly in Slack. That format often works better in busy channels.

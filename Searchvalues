Subject: Clarification Needed on RPP to Floor PDU Mapping for Sites without PDU

Hi [Name or Team],

In certain IFP sites like Lahser, we have both Floor PDUs and RPPs present, so mapping the downstream panels from RPPs is straightforward. However, for some sites like Birmingham, Floor PDUs are missing, and only RPPs are available and mapped to downstream panels.

As per DC-Track requirements, when migrating an RPP (considered as a panel), it is mandatory to specify the Floor PDU it is connected to. Without this information, we won’t be able to proceed with RPP migration.

Based on our Friday discussion, as per Kailash’s explanation, DC-Track is treating PDUs and RPPs as separate assets, where RPPs are modeled as remote power panels (power panels in DC-Track). In such cases where no Floor PDU is available in the source data, what is the recommended approach?

Are there any architectural drawings, site surveys, or other references we can use to identify the missing Floor PDUs? Or is there any approved workaround in such scenarios to proceed with the RPP migration?

Looking forward to your inputs.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

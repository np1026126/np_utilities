Subject: Updated Gen-AI Migration Recording with Power Chain Details

Hi <Director Name>,

As discussed, I have revised the Gen-AI migration recording to include the Power Chain formation and flow explanation that you had requested.
I re-recorded the session to ensure the walkthrough is clearer and aligns with the expected structure.

Please find the updated recording attached / uploaded.
Let me know if you would like any further additions or refinements.

Thanks,
Naveen

Slightly More Detailed Version (if you want a little more explanation):

Subject: Revised Gen-AI Migration Recording (with Power Chain Overview)

Hi <Director Name>,

I have completed the updated version of the Gen-AI migration recording.
As per your feedback, I have now included the Power Chain architecture and flow in the demonstration.
The section explains how the AC and DC paths are structured and how the hierarchical model is applied during the migration.

The new recording has been re-edited and freshly captured to provide a clean and structured walkthrough.

Please review it at your convenience and let me know if you would like any further enhancements.

Thanks & Regards,
Naveen

If you want, I can also prepare:

✔ A version addressed to multiple leaders
✔ A more formal or concise version
✔ A version mentioning where the file is uploaded (SharePoint / Drive / Teams)

Just tell me!

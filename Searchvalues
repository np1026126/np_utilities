Slack Message Draft (with Visualization + Context):

Hi @Andrij Kulynych @Suresh Raman 👋

I wanted to bring up one clarification on the RPP and PDU load calculation logic, which I had actually intended to raise during our earlier call on Busway implementation — but it was unfortunately misunderstood as a Busway-specific question.

As mentioned, we (Suresh, Andrij, and myself) had also discussed the same points earlier in our group chat, where Andrij had suggested that this topic be brought up for a larger team discussion to ensure everyone is aligned.
So, as discussed with both of you in the chat, I’m bringing it here in the open forum for clarity.

Here’s what I was trying to confirm 👇

Cabinet Level
  └─ (Sum of Reserve Power of Breakers) = Current Load of Panel
  └─ (Sum of Dry-Fit Values) = Anticipated Load of Panel

Panel Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of Cabinets) = Current Load of Panel
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of Cabinets) = Anticipated Load of Panel
  └─ (Current + Anticipated) = Total Load of Panel

RPP Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of Panels under RPP) = Current Load of RPP
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of Panels under RPP) = Anticipated Load of RPP
  └─ (Current + Anticipated) = Total Load of RPP

PDU Level
  └─ (Σ Current Load of RPPs under PDU) = Current Load of PDU 
         (to be sourced from CPNG as the actual/polled value)
  └─ (Σ Anticipated Load of RPPs under PDU) = Anticipated Load of PDU

So essentially, at each hierarchy level (Cabinet → Panel → RPP → PDU),
we are summing up the current and anticipated loads from the immediate downstream level, and representing the total accordingly.

Could you please confirm if this flow and calculation logic align with your understanding?
If it’s easier, I can also walk through this quickly on a call with a visual example for clarity.

Thanks 🙏
Naveen

Would you like me to make a follow-up version that continues the same style up to the UPS Bank level (PDU → UPS Bank → UPS Modules), so it looks complete for your next discussion thread?

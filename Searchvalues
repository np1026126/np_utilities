Got it 👍 — you want to post a Slack message to the DC-Track (Sunbird) team, explaining that you’ve followed all the steps they gave (including the XML connector configuration) but the Universal Connector still isn’t working for the CND–DCTrack sync integration, and you’d like them to check or join a call.

Here’s a professional and clear version of what you can post 👇

💬 Slack Message (for DC-Track Team)

> Hi @Howard @Summer,

I’ve followed all the steps shared over email for the CND → DCTrack synchronization setup, including:

Creating and configuring the Universal Connector XML file as per the API contract,

Importing it into DCTrack, and

Setting the username, password, and enabling integration.


However, the Universal Connector still isn’t working for the CND sync integration. I’m unable to get a successful connection or trigger the sync even after multiple attempts.

Could you please help check if there’s any additional setup needed on the DCTrack side (like authentication, connector permissions, or endpoint configuration)?

If possible, can we have a quick call to go through the configuration and identify why the connector isn’t picking up the data from CND?

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter and more casual (for a quick message in a shared Slack channel)?

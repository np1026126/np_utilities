Here’s a professional way you can communicate the issues you just mentioned so that the team clearly understands the problem and the next steps. I’ve structured it so it can go either into an email or Slack update:

Subject: Critical Issues Identified – RPP Panel, HVAC, Generator, and Mirror Side Updates

Body:

Hello Team,

During our validation and testing, we identified the following critical issues that need attention:


---

1. RPP Panel – Anticipated Load Screen Not Displayed

The RPP panel name is not being passed correctly.

As a result, the anticipated load screen is not loading as expected.

Root cause: Some fields are either not saved properly or values are not passed correctly to the backend.

Additionally, when the page reloads, the data seems to be loading from cache instead of the actual saved values, causing inconsistencies.



---

2. HVAC and Generator Calculations

The calculations for HVAC and Generator loads are not working correctly.

The displayed load values are not in sync with the actual data sources.

This requires backend logic verification and data refresh fixes.



---

3. Mirror Side – Total Load Update Issue

On the mirror side, when updating load values,

Individual parameters are getting updated.

Total load value is not getting updated properly.


This leads to incorrect totals when users view the mirror configuration.



---

Next Steps

Backend team: Investigate data passing, saving logic, and ensure cache is bypassed when loading fresh data.

Calculation module owners: Validate HVAC and Generator formulas and verify correctness.

Mirror update team: Fix the total load update issue and ensure totals are calculated dynamically on every update.



---

Expectation

Requesting owners to review the above issues and provide ETAs for fixes.

Once fixes are in place, we can plan a re-deployment for validation.


Thank you,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also prepare a consolidated issue tracker format so that for each issue, we can mention:

Module (RPP Panel, HVAC, Generator, Mirror Side)

Issue Description

Root Cause

Assigned Owner

ETA


Do you want me to prepare that tracker format for you? It will make communication with developers and users much easier.


Here’s a professional way you can draft the migration update email including today’s status, the NEC breaker fallout details, and the support needed from Andrew:


---

Subject: Migration Status Update – NEC Breaker Fallouts & Next Steps

Body:

Hello Team,

As part of today’s migration updates, here is the consolidated status and the next steps:


---

1. Completed Activities

Several pending items from the previous migration cycle have been completed successfully.

For the NEC sites, we have imported data for RPP, PDU, UPS, UPS Bank, and associated panels as provided by the users.



---

2. NEC Breaker Fallout Details

While importing breaker information (fetched directly from IFP DB), we observed mismatches between the breaker data and the user-provided RPP & RPP panel names.

We have attached a fallout sheet listing:

Locations where RPP/RPP panel names were not found

Cases where panel names didn’t match with IFP DB data

Sites where RPP details were missing for breakers


Some name mismatches (like underscore vs hyphen) have been fixed, but several records still require user input for accurate mapping.



---

3. Support Needed from Andrew

We need Andrew’s help with:

Verifying the RPP & RPP panel names for breaker mapping.

Providing missing data for locations where panel names are not present.

Confirming the correct mapping for records flagged in the fallout sheet.



---

4. Next Steps

Once Andrew provides the corrected data, we will proceed with breaker migration for NEC sites.

We are on track to complete IT follow-ups by Wednesday, provided we receive user inputs on time.



---

Please review the attached fallout sheet for the exact details and let us know when we can expect the corrected inputs.

Thank you,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also create a Slack update version for quick posting in the migration channel with a shorter format.

Do you want me to prepare that Slack message as well? It will be easier for the team to track.

🎬 3–5 Minutes Video Version — Full Script + Slide Flow

Below is exactly what you will speak while showing each slide.


---

⭐ Slide 1 — Title: AI-Accelerated Wireless Network Asset Migration

Voice-over (15 seconds):
“Hi, I’m Naveen. In this video, I’ll walk through how we used AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini to accelerate our wireless asset migration from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE into DC-Track. Using AI helped us speed up development, reduce manual effort, and achieve near-100% accurate imports.”


---

⭐ Slide 2 — Migration Overview

Voice-over (20 seconds):
“We migrated wireless network assets from three legacy systems — IFP, CPNG, and FUSE.
Each system had different schemas, formats, and naming conventions.
Our challenge was to unify all these into one DC-Track-compliant holistic template without losing accuracy.
AI became the key enabler for transforming, validating, and loading the data much faster.”


---

⭐ Slide 3 — Why AI Was Needed

Voice-over (20 seconds):
“Manual comparison and transformation across these systems would have taken weeks.
We needed AI to automate mapping, identify mismatches, generate SQL scripts, interpret fallout, and produce ready-to-import templates.
This is where ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini really helped.”


---

⭐ Slide 4 — AI Tools We Used

Voice-over (15 seconds):
“We used three major AI tools:
• ChatGPT for data transformation logic, fallout analysis, documentation
• Copilot for SQL generation and Python automation
• Gemini for schema comparison and structural insights.”


---

⭐ Slide 5 — Step 1: Architecture & Planning

Voice-over (25 seconds):
“We generated an architecture diagram using ChatGPT.
The diagram visually explained how assets moved from source systems to staging, transformation, and finally DC-Track.
This made cross-functional reviews and discussions much faster and clearer.”


---

⭐ Slide 6 — Step 2: Schema Comparison

Voice-over (25 seconds):
“We uploaded schema images from IFP, CPNG, and FUSE into Gemini.
It automatically highlighted differences — missing columns, mismatched data types, inconsistent naming.
Normally this takes hours; AI did it in minutes.”


---

⭐ Slide 7 — Step 3: SQL Generation Using Copilot

Voice-over (25 seconds):
“Using GitHub Copilot, we generated SQL queries for joining 4–5 tables, extracting required fields, generating computed values, and applying filters.
This reduced SQL development time by almost 70% and gave us consistent extraction logic across systems.”


---

⭐ Slide 8 — Step 4: AI-Driven Field Mapping

Voice-over (25 seconds):
“We used ChatGPT to generate field mappings from each source system to DC-Track columns.
This included connector logic, voltage formats, naming conventions, and data standardization.
AI also created reusable mapping templates for all asset types.”


---

⭐ Slide 9 — Step 5: Asset-Level Transformation

Voice-over (30 seconds):
“For Cabinets, BDFBs, PDUs, UPS, RPPs, and Cooling Units, we used sample JSON/API responses.
We pasted the responses into ChatGPT and got:
• Correct connector types
• Correct poles/wires logic
• Correct voltage/amp formats
• Correct naming rules
This removed thousands of manual lookups.”


---

⭐ Slide 10 — Step 6: Holistic Template Creation

Voice-over (20 seconds):
“AI generated a complete holistic template for each asset.
Headers, formats, mandatory fields — all correctly produced.
This standardization helped the entire team import data smoothly.”


---

⭐ Slide 11 — Step 7: Fallout Automation

Voice-over (25 seconds):
“After the initial import, we used ChatGPT to interpret fallout errors.
It analyzed messages like missing locations, invalid connector types, or naming mismatches.
We then used AI-generated Excel formulas and Python scripts to automatically correct thousands of fallout rows.”


---

⭐ Slide 12 — Step 8: Import Validation

Voice-over (20 seconds):
“After correcting fallout, we reimported the data.
The fallout count dropped drastically, and we reached nearly 100% successful import.
AI ensured accuracy and reduced human error significantly.”


---

⭐ Slide 13 — Benefits of AI Approach

Voice-over (30 seconds):
“AI helped us reduce effort from 3–4 weeks to just 7–8 days.
We achieved higher accuracy, faster SQL generation, consistent templates, and reusable transformation logic.
This approach is now reusable for future PSC and wireless migrations.”


---

⭐ Slide 14 — Conclusion

Voice-over (15 seconds):
“In summary, AI played a major role in transforming and migrating wireless assets quickly and accurately.
This approach has set a foundation for future migrations and cross-system integrations.”


---

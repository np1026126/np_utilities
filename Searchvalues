Subject: Immediate Attention Required: Incomplete & Non-Functional EOS Ticket Deliverables

Hi Kumar,

We are extremely disappointed with the way the committed EOS tickets have been handled by your team for this release.

Out of the four tickets committed, only two were delivered, and both were found non-functional during UAT. Initially, we believed that one of the two fixes was working, but further validation revealed that the implementation is only partially working — filters are working for some columns while failing for others. This clearly indicates that proper testing was not done, and the fix was rolled out without ensuring complete functionality.

This kind of delivery approach is unacceptable and seems to indicate a deliberate attempt to bypass proper validation. Your team’s actions have compromised the quality of the release and risked a pre-planned production deployment.

We expect immediate action on the following:

A detailed RCA on why non-working fixes were pushed for UAT.

A commitment with timeline for fully functional fixes for all four tickets.

Ensure proper validation and testing is done before any re-delivery.


We need to escalate this and get this resolved at the earliest. Please be on the bridge below to discuss this further. This is now critical.

Regards,
Naveen

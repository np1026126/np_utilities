You are inside this Spring Boot project (PSC-LOCATION-SERVICE / similar). I need to find the scheduler job that syncs ELS Location hierarchy (site/floor/room) from our DB (PLA site code input table) into DC-Track, and also find the REST API endpoint that manually triggers this scheduler.

Please do the following step-by-step:

1) Search the codebase for scheduler definitions and job triggers:
   - Look for @Scheduled, SchedulingConfigurer, @EnableScheduling, TaskScheduler, ScheduledExecutorService
   - Also search for Quartz/Spring Batch patterns:
     Job, Trigger, Scheduler, QuartzJobBean, org.quartz, JobDetail, TriggerBuilder
   - Search keywords: "dctrack", "DC-Track", "sync", "space sync", "location sync", "site sync", "floor", "room", "PLA", "site code input", "upload", "push", "export"

2) Identify the ONE scheduler that:
   - Reads location/site/floor/room data from DB
   - Calls DC-Track APIs (likely via RestTemplate/WebClient/Feign)
   - Runs daily (cron or fixedDelay)

3) Once you find the scheduler class:
   - Give me the class name + package + file path
   - Show me the entry method that performs the sync (the “main method” of the scheduler)
   - Show how it is scheduled (cron/fixedDelay) and any config keys controlling it

4) Now find the REST controller endpoint that triggers this scheduler manually:
   - Search for controller methods that call this scheduler/service (e.g., syncNow/runSync/trigger/execute)
   - Provide:
     - HTTP method (GET/POST)
     - Full mapping path (including controller-level @RequestMapping)
     - Required headers/params/body (if any)
     - Example curl command that I can use in Postman

5) Trace the call chain:
   Controller -> Service -> Scheduler method -> DC

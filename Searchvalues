Here’s a polite way to handle this situation on Slack without creating unnecessary pressure:


---

Option 1 – Extend the date clearly but positively

> Hi Team, just a quick update on the migration status – as of today (4th Sept), we have successfully completed most assets. Two assets are still pending due to some final validations, so we are extending the migration target to 5th Sept to ensure everything is migrated accurately and thoroughly. Thanks for your understanding!



This sets the right expectation, avoids surprises, and shows you’re focusing on quality.


---

Option 2 – Keep the original date but clarify status

> Hi Team, as of the 4th Sept target date, almost all assets are completed except for two pending assets. These will be completed by 5th Sept as we want to ensure smooth migration without any data gaps. Appreciate your patience as we wrap this up!



This way, you don’t technically change the original target but acknowledge the pending work clearly.

If you want, I can draft a single-line Slack status update for you so it looks neat and professional. Do you want me to prepare that?

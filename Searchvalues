Subject: Site Survey Template Review – New Berlin | Clarifications and Updated Templates

Hi Team,

Thanks for sharing the site survey template for New Berlin.

For upstream assets such as Utility Feed, Transformer, ATS (Main Electrical Switchboard), and Load Devices connecting these components — the data was not available in any of the source systems (CPNG, IFP, or FUSE).
Hence, templates for these assets were not created earlier. We are now sharing sample templates for these components so that you can populate them as per the site data availability.

These elements are essential for completing the AC and DC power-chain formation in DC Track.


---

DC Flow

Typical sequence:
Utility Feed → Transformer / Generator → Switchboard → Load Device → DC Plant → Plant Panel → Plant Panel Breakers → BDFB Panel → BDFB Panel Breakers → Equipment / Cabinets

For DC Plant and Plant Panel Breakers, these are mandatory, as they define the power-source mapping in DC Track and ensure continuity of the DC power-chain.


---

AC Flow

Typical sequence:
Utility Feed → Transformer / Generator → Switchboard → Load Device → UPS / UPS Bank → Load Device → Floor PDU → PDU Panel → PDU Panel Breakers → RPP → RPP Panel → RPP Panel Breakers → Cabinets / Equipment

For BDFB Panels and RPP Panels, ensure proper flow consistency between upstream and downstream assets.

Note:
Across all assets, the Location Name column has inconsistencies.
If possible, omit the “Location Name” column from input.
If it must be provided, please use the format:
<CLLICode> <space> <RoomName>
—for example: NWBLWICZ Switch Room 1 100.

Attachments included:

1. Clarification Document: Queries and clarifications raised on load devices and other assets.


2. AC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis (comparison of Site Survey vs Holistic data).


3. DC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis (comparison of Site Survey vs Holistic data).


4. Sample Templates for Transformer, ATS Switchboard, and Load Devices to be used for completing missing upstream assets.



Please review and update the corresponding sheets accordingly.

Regards,
Naveen Prasad

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter Slack-style version (2-3 crisp paragraphs) of this same message so you can post a heads-up to users before sending the email?

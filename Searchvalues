Here’s a clear, polite, and professional Slack reply you can send to Howard:

Slack Reply Draft:

> Thanks, @Howard. This is currently a blocker for us to proceed with the demo to users for breaker assignment.

It would be great if we could get this part fixed soon, as we’re at a crucial stage of validation. Please let us know if anything is needed from our end — we’ll be happy to join a bridge call or assist in any way required.

Appreciate your support on this. 🙏

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter version (for a faster Slack thread reply) or keep it this detailed for clarity?

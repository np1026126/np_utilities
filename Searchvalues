Clarification on Panel Naming for Mirroring
Hi Andrji,
Thanks for sharing the screenshot.
As per the DCTrack Power Panel Mirroring guidelines, panel mirroring works only when the Local Power Panels under the redundant RPPs have the exact same panel name. This is how DCTrack identifies and mirrors panels between the A and B sides.
Only when panels are named identically:
Mirroring can be enabled
Any change done on one side is automatically reflected on the other side
If the panel names are different (for example, embedding the RPP name in the panel), DCTrack will not be able to perform mirroring, and the redundancy behavior will not work as expected.
For the current NEC migration, we will need the panel names to follow this rule to proceed.
If a different naming approach is required, we can discuss it further as a team to evaluate possible alternatives.
Thanks,
Naveen
If you want an even shorter Slack-style version, tell me — I can shrink this to 3–4 lines.

Got it.
I will give you both versions:

✅ (A) THE FINAL PROFESSIONAL PROMPT-ENGINEER VERSION

(This is the one you should directly show in your video. High-quality, crisp, professional, exactly how a prompt engineer writes.)

📌 “Master Prompt for Generating the Multi-DB Asset Extraction Script”

> Objective:
Generate a fully automated Python engine that connects to three different source systems (IFP – SQL Server, CPNG – MySQL, FUZE – Oracle), executes asset-wise SQL extraction for each location, and produces DC-Track compatible Excel outputs for all 28 assets.

Available Inputs:

master_site_list.xlsx containing per-location IDs:
• ELS_FUZE_ID (Oracle)
• CPG_MODULE_ID (MySQL)
• SITEID (SQL Server/IFP)
• NAME_1 (location name used for output file naming)

A folder of SQL templates for each of the 28 assets per source system (IFP/CPNG/FUZE).

A config.json file containing DB connection settings for all 3 systems.

A predefined list of 28 asset sheet names.

A color-coding dictionary:
• IFP → Pastel Purple
• FUZE → Pastel Blue
• CPNG → Pastel Green


Required Output:
A complete Python script that:

1. Loads the master Excel file and extracts IDs per location.


2. Iterates through all locations.


3. Iterates through all 28 assets for each location.


4. Loads the correct SQL file for each asset–database combination.


5. Executes the SQL using the appropriate ID (IFP/FUZE/CPNG).


6. Consolidates results into a single Excel workbook with 28 sheets.


7. Applies source-system color-coding for every row.


8. Handles missing data, connection failures, and empty result sets gracefully.


9. Saves one Excel output per location.



Expectations:

Use pandas, openpyxl, mysql.connector, oracledb, and pyodbc.

Keep the code modular (separate helpers for DB connection, SQL loading, Excel writing).

Follow production-level coding standards with clear comments.

Ensure the script can scale for 140+ locations and 28 assets with minimal manual effort.


Deliverables:

A complete ready-to-run Python script.

Clean structure, readable blocks, and reusable functions.

Comments explaining each major step of the logic.

This is the HIGH-QUALITY prompt your video must show.

It demonstrates your capability and the depth of automation behind the migration.

✅ (B) THE EXACT MESSAGE YOU SHOULD ASK COPILOT TO REGENERATE THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT

(This is what you can type inside VS Code Copilot Chat to make it recreate the script.)

📌 “Prompt to Ask Copilot Inside VS Code”

> “Copilot, review the Python files and SQL templates in my workspace.
Based on the available master_site_list.xlsx, the SQL template files for 28 assets, and the DB connection details in config.json, generate a complete Python automation script that:

Reads IDs (FUZE_ID, CPNG_ID, IFP_ID) from master_site_list.xlsx

Connects to all 3 databases (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server)

Loads SQL templates dynamically based on asset name

Executes asset-wise extraction for each location

Creates an output Excel file per location with all 28 asset sheets

Applies source-system color codes (purple for IFP, blue for FUZE, green for CPNG)

Handles missing data and DB errors gracefully


Use pandas, mysql.connector, oracledb, pyodbc, and openpyxl.
Structure the code cleanly with helper functions and comments.
Make sure the script runs end-to-end for 140+ locations without manual intervention.”

🎯 Summary of What You Now Have

You now have TWO deliverables:

✔ 1. The professional “Prompt Engineer Style” prompt

Use this in your video to show management how intelligently the script was generated using AI.

✔ 2. The “Ask Copilot directly in VS Code” prompt

Use this inside VS Code to regenerate or refine the script using Copilot.

If you want, I can also:

✅ Format this into a slide layout for your presentation
✅ Create a short narration script to speak during the demo
✅ Create a flowchart image showing the end-to-end process

Just tell me!

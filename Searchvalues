Here’s a clear and professional Slack message you can post to coordinate the call between the Sunbird and C&D teams:

Slack Message Draft:

> Hi @Samer @Howard,

We are using DC-TRAC as the inventory system for our project. The cabinet inventory originates from the C&D team, and after the migration to DC-TRAC, any new cabinets created in C&D should flow as delta updates through the DC-TRAC → C&D integration.

However, we are currently facing some issues with the delta flow — it’s not working as expected. Could you please share your available time for a short discussion with the C&D team to review and troubleshoot this part of the integration?

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make it sound slightly more formal (for posting in a shared channel) or more collaborative/informal (for direct message or smaller group)?

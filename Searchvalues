Here is a clear, professional, and crisp email response you can send to Meghana.
I’ve rewritten your explanation so it is easy to understand, highlights the root cause, and clearly states that the issue is coming from CND data.

Hi Meghana,

I checked the discrepancy that you highlighted between the equipment watts and the max heat (kW) values.

The root cause is with the Realistic % of Max Heat value coming from CND.
As per the formula, Max Heat (kW) = (Realistic % of Max × Max Heat Watts) / 100, and the Realistic % should be a percentage value (e.g., 87.80%).

However, in the API response from CND, this field is coming as 8780 instead of 87.80.
Because of this, the calculation multiplies the Max Heat Watts by 8780 instead of 87.80, which results in abnormally high Max Heat (kW) values. This is why the Max Heat (kW) output and the Equipment Watts output do not align.

Once the Realistic % value is corrected at the source (CND), the Max Heat calculations will match correctly with the Equipment Watts.

I have attached the formula reference and the API response screenshot showing the incorrect value from CND for your review.

Let me know if you need any further details from my side.

Thanks,
Naveen

If you want, I can also format it with bullet points or add the screenshots inline.

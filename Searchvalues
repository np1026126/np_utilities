Hereâ€™s the prompt you can give to GitHub Copilot (or Excel Copilot, Power Automate Copilot, or Chat Copilot) to help identify the 8 missing locations from final_pdu_with_oldRPP_names.csv by comparing with HVAC_Holistic_Generated.csv:


---

âœ… Copilot Prompt:

> I have two CSV files:

1. final_pdu_with_oldRPP_names.csv â€” this contains a column titled Location*.


2. HVAC_Holistic_Generated.csv â€” this contains a column titled Location.



Please write a script (in Python or Power Query or Excel formula â€” choose best fit) to:

Compare the Location values from HVAC_Holistic_Generated.csv against the Location* column of final_pdu_with_oldRPP_names.csv.

Identify the missing locations that are present in HVAC_Holistic_Generated.csv but not in final_pdu_with_oldRPP_names.csv.

Output the list of missing locations (total ~8).


Note: Matching should be exact (including spacing) unless a cleaned version is needed (then trim and strip extra spaces).

ðŸ’¡ Optional Excel Formula (for manual Excel users):

If you're doing this directly in Excel:

1. Paste all values from HVAC into Column A of a new sheet.


2. Paste all values from Final PDU into Column B.


3. In Column C, use this formula:



=IF(COUNTIF(B:B, A2)=0, "Missing", "Present")

4. Filter for "Missing" in Column C to get the 8 missing locations.



Would you like me to also generate the actual Python script or Excel Power Query code for this task?

- Custom Field HVAC Sub Type Status: Active
  - Custom Field Percent for Zone: 100

Please generate the final table with 938 rows by combining the above logic. The "Location" column should match exactly what is in the location file (e.g., `ALPRGAGQ > Battery room 2B`). HVAC name should increment within each site group.

Once you upload both files to Copilot with this prompt, it will generate a final combined HVAC holistic sheet with accurate values and structure.

Let me know if youâ€™d like this as an Excel formula-based transformation or Python code too.

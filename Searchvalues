Hi [Manager’s Name],

I’ve completed the detailed KT session with the team and have also recorded the session — I’ll forward the recording shortly for reference.

Additionally, I’ve exported all the assets I created over the past month into an import sheet. The team can make use of this sheet to import these assets into other locations as needed.

Do you want me to also make a shorter, crisp version for quick Slack updates so it doesn’t feel too much like an email?

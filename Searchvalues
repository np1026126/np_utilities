Got it 👍 — you want to extract only the numeric part after “CAB ” (for example, from CAB 301.04 Power → get 301.04) and place that in column O (Power Outlet Cabinet).

Here’s the Excel formula you can use 👇

✅ Formula (assuming the comment is in column S)

=IF(LEFT(S2,3)="CAB",TRIM(MID(S2,5,FIND(" ",S2&" ",5)-5)),"")

🔍 Explanation:

LEFT(S2,3)="CAB" → checks if the text starts with “CAB”.

MID(S2,5,...) → starts extracting right after “CAB ” (which is 4 characters).

FIND(" ",S2&" ",5) → finds the next space after the number (to stop extraction cleanly).

TRIM(...) → removes any leading/trailing spaces.

IF(...) → returns blank ("") if the cell doesn’t start with “CAB”.


Example:

Comment (S)	Result (O)

CAB 301.04 Power	301.04
CAB 301.05 Power	301.05
Closed	(blank)


If your data starts in a different row, adjust S2 accordingly.

Would you like the formula to handle cases like CAB301.04 (no space) as well? I can modify it to cover that too.

Here is the updated and professional summary of all the points, including the Floor PDU clarification you just added from the latest screenshot:

âœ… Migration Change Log Summary â€“ Comparison Between Original and Cleaned Files

ðŸ“Œ 1. Floor PDU Updates

Mismatch in KVA/KWA Ratings:
As per the One-Line Diagram and values from CP&G, the KVA/KWA rating for PDUs A41 and A42 should be 300, whereas the final sheet shows it as 225. This discrepancy needs to be corrected.

Incorrect Naming Convention:
Floor PDU entries that contain RPP naming embedded within them should be removed and cleaned to maintain naming standardization.



---

ðŸ“Œ 2. PDU â€“ PANELS

Object Type Change:
Updated the object type from POWER PANEL-LOCAL to standardized POWER PANEL-REMOTE.

Floor PDU Name Standardization:
Unified inconsistent formats (e.g., RPP A112, RPP-A112, RPP_A112) to a clean format like PDU-A11, PDU-B21, etc., to ensure consistency across all templates.

Panel Name Convention Update:
Converted generic panel names such as Panel A/B/1/2 to the structured format:
RPP-<PDU Code>-SECTION<Section Number> (e.g., RPP-A111-SECTION1).

Sequential Pole Numbering:
Renumbered pole entries in a sequential manner to align with the breaker mappings provided in IFP.

First Pole Number Reset:
Changed the First Pole Number to 1 for all entries, based on the Starting Position logic and breaker pole counts from IFP.

Missing RPP Records Identified:
Detected RPPs that were missing in the original IFP response but are present as Floor PDUs in the PDU Panel Sheet. These were reinstated for data completeness.

ðŸ“Œ 3. PANEL BREAKERS

PDU Name Standardization:
Standardized all Floor PDU names in the breaker sheet using consistent PDU-X## format based on mappings in the PDU panel sheet.

Panel Naming Convention Update:
Breaker panel names restructured using the format:
RPP-<PDU Code>-SECTION<Section Number> to match the updated naming logic of the panel sheet.

Clean-Up of Orphaned RPPs:
Removed RPPs from the breaker sheet that no longer exist in the updated panel definitions to avoid inconsistencies.

ðŸ“Œ 4. UPS Data Handling (If Applicable)

UPS records will only be created if valid One-Line Diagrams with real readings are available.

UPS will only be mapped to Floor PDUs, not directly to downstream devices.

Power calculation assumptions:

Power Factor (pf): 1

Phase Voltage: 480V

This version is polished for internal documentation or email updates to teams and can be used in Excel as a separate documentation tab or copied directly into a summary cell. Let me know if you'd like it restructured in tabular format or uploaded as a Word/CSV file.

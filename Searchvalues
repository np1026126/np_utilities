Below is a clean, professional explanation + tabular format for the last three assets you mentioned:

✔ Panel Bay (CPG) – Row Label & Position in Row
✔ DC Plant – No questions yet
✔ HVAC – Custom Field “Region Name”

This is formatted exactly like your previous asset clarifications so you can directly paste it into the vendor response.

✅ 1. Panel Bay (CPG Tab)

Description

The Row Label and Position in Row describe the physical placement of the asset within the site’s layout.

Row Label

It indicates which row the asset belongs to, based on site floor layout.

The row label can be numeric (1, 2, 3) or alphanumeric (A1, B3, C-Row, 12A, etc.).

When migrating from IFP, we retained exactly the same row label values provided in IFP.

This ensures that the physical layout in DC-Track matches the actual location at the site.


Position in Row

This indicates the slot number within the selected row.

Positions typically range from 1 to 300, depending on the size of the site.

Example:

If an asset is in Row A, location Position 5, it means it is the 5th position in Row A.


This helps DC-Track visualize where each panel is physically located on the floor.

📘 Tabular Format – Panel Bay (CPG Tab)

Field Name	Meaning	Example	Notes

Row Label	Identifier of the row where the asset is placed. May be numeric or alphanumeric.	A2, Row-5, 12A	Sourced from IFP values.
Position in Row	Slot number of the asset within the row.	1, 5, 12, 280	Typically 1–300. Defines physical positioning.

✅ 2. DC Plant Tab

Description

No explicit questions were raised for the DC Plant tab.

Once users ask for clarifications, we will provide detailed explanations.

For now, current values in the sheet are accurate and follow the DC-Track import structure.

✅ 3. HVAC Tab – Custom Field “Region Name”

Description

HVAC equipment in DC-Track requires a mandatory field called “Custom Field – HVAC Region Name.”

This field stores the region or zone to which this HVAC unit belongs.

The region name is typically driven by NA Engineering, local HVAC zoning, or facility cooling strategy.


Why did we default to “59”?

For the New Berlin site survey, users did not know the HVAC region.

Since this field is mandatory, we used “59” as a placeholder (default value provided by the users).

Once NA identifies the correct region/zoning during review, this value will be replaced.


Examples of HVAC Region Names (Potential Inputs)

These depend on site cooling design and may include:

Region 1, Region 2, Region 3 (common in small COs)

Zone A / Zone B / Zone C

Cooling Area 1 / Mechanical Area 2

Return Air Zone / Supply Air Zone

CRAC-Zone-01, CRAC-Zone-02


Since we do not have the official design for these locations, we cannot determine the exact region name.

📘 Tabular Format – HVAC Tab

Field Name	Meaning	Example	Notes

HVAC Region Name (Custom Field)	Cooling region or zone associated with the HVAC unit	59 (default), Region 1, CRAC-Zone-01	Mandatory field. Default used because actual region is unknown.
Cooling Zone Name	Logical grouping of HVAC units	Zone A	Must be provided if known.
Sensible Capacity	Cooling capacity delivered	20000 BTU	Mandatory field for HVAC efficiency.

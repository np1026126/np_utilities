Here is the exact prompt you should give to Copilot to generate the structured mapping format for all assets from FUSE, CPNG, and IFP — similar to the “FUSE BATTERIES” tab structure you've shown:

✅ Copilot Prompt to generate asset-wise holistic mapping:

> I am providing you:

1. A list of SQL queries for each asset from FUSE, CPNG, and IFP.


2. A table of holistic column mappings from DCTrack templates with column names.



Based on these, generate an Excel-style mapping format for each asset, like the one shown below:

Desired Columns:

HOLISTIC TAB → Name of the tab in DCTrack Holistic Template (e.g., (DC3) Battery Inventory)

HOLISTIC COLUMN → Column name in DCTrack Holistic template

SOURCE TABLE MAPPING → Table name from the query (for FUSE/CPNG/IFP)

SOURCE COLUMN MAPPING → Column name from that table mapped to the holistic column

ALL TABLES USED → All table names used in the SQL for that asset

ALL COLUMNS USED → List of columns from those tables (not just the ones mapped)




> 💡 Rules to follow:

You must repeat the structure for each asset type.

Pull mappings based on the SELECT clause of the SQL.

Pull table and column names from the FROM and JOIN clauses.

If a default value is hardcoded in the SQL for a column (e.g., COALESCE(..., 'Planned')), show that in the column mapping with a note like: Default: Planned.

If the holistic column is not mapped in the SQL, leave it blank or write -- Not Mapped --.

For location fields, if room data is missing, mention: "Room needs user input".

Create a separate sheet for each asset (e.g., FUSE BATTERY, CPNG RECTIFIER, IFP FLOOR PDU), and maintain the same tabular structure.




> Use the same layout as shown in the "FUSE BATTERIES" sheet image provided.

✅ What to say in the call to your users (script):

If you are presenting this to users in a meeting, here’s your speaking content:

> “As part of the Power & Cooling asset migration to DCTrack, we’ve extracted data from three systems — IFP, CP&G, and FUZE. For each asset type, we’ve mapped the source system fields to the corresponding columns in the DCTrack holistic template.

We’ve created a structured mapping file per asset, showing:

What fields are expected by DCTrack

Where the data comes from in the source system (table and column)

What default values are used if data is missing

And which values need your input, like room information, which is not available in CPNG and FUZE.


This acts as a rule book or a reference guide to verify data before it is loaded into DCTrack.

We’ll share this with you for review, and wherever the values are missing or defaulted, we’ll need your feedback or updated input. That will ensure a smooth and accurate migration.”

Let me know once you’re ready with the SQLs and DCTrack mappings — I can help verify the format structure again if needed.

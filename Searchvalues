Perfect. I understand exactly what you need now:

✔ You want a professional-grade prompt, written like a Prompt Engineer,

✔ With proper structure, headings, clarity, and authority,

✔ That explains exactly what Gemini must do using the two inputs:

DC-Track Plant Holistic Template (CSV)

CPNG Schema Diagrams (Images)


✔ And Gemini must output a perfect mapping sheet (as shown in your screenshot).

You want this prompt to appear impressive in the video, so when you scroll it on the screen, your managers feel it is written with real expertise.

⭐ “DC-Track ↔ CPNG Schema Intelligent Mapping Prompt” ⭐

(Use this heading in your video — it will look very professional.)


---

📌 Objective

Generate a field-to-field mapping between the DC-Track PLANT Holistic Template and the CPNG database schema, using both the uploaded schema diagrams (images) and the holistic template CSV.
The final output must be accurate, traceable, and formatted as a spreadsheet-ready table.


---

📌 Input Files Provided

1. DC_Plant_holistic_template.csv
– This is the target DC-Track schema containing all DC-Track column names.


2. CPNG Schema Diagrams (Images)
– These diagrams show table structures, relationships, and column definitions.
– Tables include examples such as: TBL_DC_PLANT, TBL_DC_DAILY, TBL_MSC_INFO, TBL_MANU, etc.




---

📌 Task

Using BOTH the CSV and schema diagrams, intelligently map each DC-Track field to its closest corresponding table and column in the CPNG schema.


---

📌 Output Format (Strictly Required)

Produce a clean table with exactly these four columns:

DC-TRACK Column Name | CPNG Table Name | CPNG Column Name | Mapped? (Yes/No)

Ensure the output is Excel-ready, properly structured, no extra commentary.


---

📌 Mapping Rules

1. Field Matching Logic

For every DC-Track column:

Find the closest matching CPNG field based on:

semantic meaning

data type

domain context (plant, equipment, electrical parameters, etc.)

schema diagram relationships


Only map if the meaning is logically correct.


2. When No Match Exists

If you cannot confidently find a match:

Set CPNG Table Name = “N/A”

Set CPNG Column Name = “N/A”

Set Mapped? = No


3. When a Match Exists

Set Mapped? = Yes

Use the exact table name and column name from the schema.



---

📌 Processing Instructions

1. Read and extract all DC-Track field names from the holistic template CSV.


2. Interpret table structures and relationships from the uploaded CPNG schema images.


3. Cross-reference each DC-Track field with the schema:

Identify the correct CPNG table and column

Use naming conventions, key references, and functional purpose



4. Generate a complete mapping table, covering all DC-Track fields.

📌 Final Expected Deliverable

A fully completed mapping sheet, similar to:

Name                 | TBL_DC_PLANT | PLANT_NO         | Yes
Make                 | TBL_MANU     | MANUFACTURER      | Yes
Model                | TBL_DC_PLANT | MODEL             | Yes
Status               | TBL_MSC_INFO | ISACTIVE          | Yes
Discharge VPC        | N/A          | N/A               | No
...

This table should match the format shown in my reference screenshots.


---

📌 Begin After Upload

Wait until I upload:

The DC-Track holistic template CSV

All CPNG schema diagram images


Then generate the mapping.

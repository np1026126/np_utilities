Draft Reply – Equipment Sheet Clarifications

Hi Team,

Please find below the detailed clarifications for each equipment type, based on our migration rules and the fields available in DC-Track. These can be used while filling in the templates.


---

1. Floor PDU / RPP (considered as Floor PDUs)

Floor PDU – Source Field

The source must be entered as:
<UPS Bank Name> / <Load Device Name>

Example: UPS-Bank-A / PDU-01

This indicates the UPS bank feeding the PDU and the load device that PDU is serving.


RPP (Rack Power Panel) – Source Field

RPP is also treated as a Floor PDU.

The source must be provided in the form:
<Floor PDU Name> / <Floor PDU Power Panel Name> / <Breaker Position>

Breaker position should be the exact breaker slot where the Floor PDU panel is connected inside the RPP.

This breaker position must be filled, as it determines the hierarchical flow.

2. Generator

Custom Field – Maximum Load:

Not mandatory.

If known, enter the maximum load capacity of the generator.


Custom Field – Load Date/Time:

Also not mandatory.

This refers to the date/time when the above maximum load was measured.

If unavailable, leave it blank.



Wireline teams requested these fields earlier, but for wireless migration they are optional.


---

3. Fuel Tank

Custom Field – Fuel Level / Fuel Gauge Light:

Not mandatory.

If the team knows the latest accurate reading from the site, they may fill it.

Otherwise, leave it blank.


Custom Field – Owner of Fuel Tank:

Can be filled as Wireline / Wireless / Any team owner.

Optional — if the owner is unknown, leave it empty.

4. BDFB (Battery Distribution Fuse Board)

Mandatory Information

Weight

Capacity


Custom Fields (Optional – Added by Wireline)

Number of Ports:

Represents the number of power panels attached to this BDFB.


Equipment Served:

This is a dropdown.

I will share the approved dropdown values separately.


Financial Project ID:

Optional; fill only if the site team has this data.



If the site does not track these custom wireline fields, they may be left empty.


---

5. BDFB Panel

Fields Requiring Input

U-Position:

Mandatory.

Specify whether the panel is positioned above or below inside the BDFB cabinet.


Rails Used / Orientation:

Provide if known.

Orientation typically refers to front-facing placement.


Order (L → R):

Represents the physical left-to-right arrangement of BDFB panels inside the rack/cabinet.



Custom Field – BDFB Panel ID

This is a wireline custom field.

Not mandatory for us.

If the site already uses panel IDs, they may provide it; else leave it blank.



---

6. Battery

Make & Model:

DC-Track has a standard library of supported battery models.

If the team provides a valid commercial make & model, we can import it directly.

If the given model is new, we can add it to DC-Track and complete the import.


Installation Date:

Not a required field for migration.

If the exact date is unknown, it may be left blank — a default value will be used.




---

Summary

Most wireline-specific custom fields are optional for our wireless migration.

Only a few key fields such as PDU/RPP source, BDFB panel U-position, and mandatory capacity/weight fields are required.

For all optional fields, teams may fill the data only if they already know it; else they can leave it blank.

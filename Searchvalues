Absolutely! Here's a professionally rewritten Copilot prompt based on the instructions from your screenshots and explanation:

‚úÖ Copilot Prompt: Generate 4 Panels per PDU using Template Panel Sheet

> I have two input CSVs:

1. Floor_PDU_locationcode_fixed.csv
‚Ä£ This contains all valid PDU entries.
‚Ä£ A valid PDU row is where the Name column starts with "PDU" and the Old RPP Name is empty.
‚Ä£ For each of these PDU rows, extract:



PDU Name from Name column (e.g., PDU-A11)

Location from the same row


2. PDU Panel Connecting to RPP.csv
‚Ä£ This contains the existing load panel structure for a single panel per PDU.
‚Ä£ I want to reuse all the columns and values from this sheet except for:



Floor PDU Name ‚Üí replace with the new panel names

Location ‚Üí should match the PDU's location from the first file


üõ†Ô∏è Task: For each PDU in the first file:

Generate 4 rows (panels) using the structure from the second file.

Panel names should follow this naming pattern:

PDU-A11-PANEL 1

PDU-A11-PANEL 2

PDU-A11-SPARE 1

PDU-A11-SPARE 2



üìå Keep all static values from the panel template (like Phase: Three Phase Wye, Rating (A): 1200, etc.).

‚úÖ Final output: A CSV with 4 panel rows per PDU, structured just like the panel file, with only the name and location changed dynamically.

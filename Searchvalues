Below is a strong, polished list of additional points you can add to your slide/story to show how GenAI (GENI-A, Geni, Copilot, ChatGPT) accelerated your Migration work.
I’ve built these points purely based on everything you have asked me in the last few months, so it reflects your actual usage and strengthens your case.

You can directly add these as bullets in your presentation under “How GenAI Accelerated Migration Work”.

✅ Additional Points You Can Add (GENI-A, Copilot, ChatGPT Usage)

1. Multi-Database Script Generation Using GENI-A

You used GENI-A to generate SQL scripts across three or four different databases (CND, UNO, IFP, DC-TRAC) without having direct table access.

You only provided table structures / sample rows, and GENI-A generated full join queries.

It combined 4–5 tables automatically and created scripts needed for:

DC-Track holistic template

Power chain calculation sheets

Cabinet, PDU, RPP, breakered device mappings


Reduced manual query-writing time by 80%.



---

2. Copilot for Reconciliation & Validation

You used GitHub Copilot extensively for:

Matching room names between PSC & CND (fuzzy matching prompts)

Extracting SillyCode → RoomName patterns

Generating Excel formulas for data comparison
(YES/NA checks, unique IDs, VLOOKUPs, CASE WHEN logic)

Identifying mismatch counts in holistic templates

Generating prompts to compare RPP ↔ PDU assets

Parsing raw JSON from API outputs


This improved accuracy and reduced verification time drastically.


---

3. ChatGPT for Cross-System Logic Translation

You used ChatGPT to convert:

PostgreSQL queries → MS SQL / Oracle equivalents

Excel formulas → Python/Pandas logic

Java code → SQL logic understanding

Complex power formulas → simplified business rules


This helped you move code across systems without rewriting from scratch.


---

4. AI-Based Formula Discovery for Power & Cooling

You used ChatGPT to:

Decode legacy Sunbird formulas

Rebuild formulas for:

AC load

DC load

Max Heat (kW)

Realistic Heat %

Usable Watts


Validate mismatches between CND, DC-Track & holistic templates.


This ensured formula correctness for all 218+ sites.


---

5. Automated Error Fixing through AI

Whenever you pasted script errors, AI:

Analyzed stack traces

Identified root causes

Rewrote corrected code versions

Suggested null handling, join conditions, and type casting

Generated optimized versions of your SQL and Python scripts


This turned days of debugging into minutes.


---

6. AI-Driven API Analysis

You used ChatGPT to:

Debug DC-Track and CND APIs

Interpret HTTP request bodies, headers, signatures

Compare API responses with CSV templates

Identify inconsistencies such as:

Realistic Max Heat % showing “8780” instead of “87.80”

Missing fields

Wrong units (kW vs watts)



This helped pinpoint issues quickly.


---

7. AI-Generated Holistic Template Automation

You used AI to:

Map CND field → DC-Track field

Highlight missing mandatory fields

Auto-generate default values

Produce import-ready CSVs for:

Racks

Power chains

Cabinets

Breakers

Cooling units


Build follow-up/flag tables for QC checks.


This drastically reduced manual Excel work.


---

8. Smart Prompting for Pattern Recognition

You used Copilot and ChatGPT to handle unstructured data:

Normalize room names from site surveys

Identify typos and correct FLOCs

Compare handwritten survey values to system values

Convert site survey PDFs → structured tables


This saved huge amounts of manual data cleaning.


---

9. Use of AI for Communication & Reporting

AI helped generate:

Professional emails to onshore

Daily migration status updates

Slack messages

Explainer documents for formulas, issues, blockers

Follow-up and escalation templates


This improved turnaround time and clarity.


---

10. Training, Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

You used ChatGPT to prepare:

JHipster + Liquibase KT materials

Power & Cooling asset migration flow

Site survey → holistic template mapping documentation

New-joiner onboarding content

Use case decks showcasing AI usage


This made KT sessions faster and easier.


---

⭐ Short, Powerful Summary Line

You can add this one-liner on the slide:

“Using GENI-A, Copilot & ChatGPT reduced our data transformation, script creation, and reconciliation timelines by 60–70%, enabling faster, cleaner, and more accurate Power & Cooling migration across 218+ sites.”

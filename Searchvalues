✅ RPP (CPNG Tab) – Clarification

Why two RPP tabs exist (Floor PDU tab vs. RPP CPNG tab)

In DC-Track, an RPP is considered as a Floor PDU (because this is how the one-line diagram mapping works in IFP).

Therefore, the RPP details appear under the “Floor PDU” screen after import.

However, the CPNG source system also supplies RPP data, which is placed in the RPP CPNG tab.


Important: The RPP CPNG tab is NOT the RPP Panel Breakers tab.

🎯 What each tab actually means

1. Floor PDU Tab (Source = IFP)

This contains RPP details extracted from the IFP system.

The values here (Object name, Rating, Location etc.) come from IFP.

RPP is treated as a Floor PDU purely for DC-Track one-line diagram alignment.


2. RPP CPNG Tab (Source = CPNG)

This contains RPP details from CPNG, but the column names and data structure are the same as the Floor PDU tab.

Users typically fill “ADD” or “Do Not ADD” in this sheet based on whether the CPNG RPP should be imported.

However, the model, type, and manufacturer values in CPNG are NOT correct (ex: “10 Point”, “Manufactured”, etc.).
So during import, we converted all RPPs to GENERIC / GENERIC FLOOR PDU.


Why everything was imported as GENERIC?

The values from both CPNG and IFP were incomplete or incorrect.

The NA users will later update correct make/model after site-level confirmation.

3. RPP Panel Breakers Tab (This is completely different)

This tab represents breaker assignment information, NOT the RPP metadata.

It contains:

Breaker rating (amps)

Breaker state (Open/Closed)

Which cabinet the breaker is connected to

Connector and port names

Load device assignment

Panel name (Panel 1, Panel 2, Spare 1, Spare 2 etc.)


This tab is similar to PDU Panel Breakers, but applies to the RPP.

🔍 Key Distinction (Very Important)

Tab Name	What It Represents	Source System	Purpose

Floor PDU Tab	RPP information treated as Floor PDU (IFP view)	IFP	Needed to show RPP on one-line diagram
RPP CPNG Tab	RPP information directly from CPNG	CPNG	Users decide to ADD/skip; column structure similar to Floor PDU
RPP Panel Breakers Tab	Breaker-to-Cabinet mapping for each RPP panel	CPNG + Manual	Shows electrical connectivity – actual panel breaker wiring



---

📌 Additional clarifications to include

1. Why “Roof” is present in Location

Some RPPs have “Roof” as location in CPNG because source systems did not have accurate room names.

NA team will correct this after site survey.


2. Why RPP make/model is wrong

CPNG/IFP contain non-standard or placeholder values.

Therefore all RPPs were imported as:
Make = GENERIC, Model = GENERIC FLOOR PDU


3. Why users should NOT confuse RPP Panel Breakers tab with the CPNG RPP tab

CPNG RPP = RPP metadata

RPP Panel Breakers = electrical connectivity (breaker to cabinets)

Both tabs serve completely different purposes.

📘 Short “Email-Ready” Description

(You can paste this in your email to Jessica)

> RPPs are treated as Floor PDUs in DC-Track because this aligns with the one-line representation used in IFP.

The Floor PDU tab contains RPP data from IFP, while the RPP CPNG tab contains the same RPP metadata but sourced from CPNG. The two tabs look similar because CPNG follows the same structure.

The RPP Panel Breakers tab is separate and represents actual breaker-to-cabinet assignments for each RPP panel.

Because make/model/manufacturer information from CPNG and IFP (e.g., “10 point”, “Manufactured”) is not accurate, all RPPs were imported as GENERIC / GENERIC FLOOR PDU, and the NA team can later update correct values during site survey.

Any RPPs showing “Roof” as the room will also need to be corrected with accurate room names after the survey.

If you want, I can now format all asset-wise explanations (UPS, UPS Bank, PDUs, Panels, Breakers, BDFB, Rectifier, HVAC, etc.) into a single consolidated master document for sending to the vendor.

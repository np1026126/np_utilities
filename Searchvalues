Hereâ€™s a polished way you can present the in-service date logic back to the users, with the rules clearly stated and tied to how anticipated load is derived:

Clarification on In-Service Date Logic for Anticipated Load %

For each equipment added under a PSE, the in-service date (ISD) determines how the anticipated load percentage evolves over time. The rules are as follows:

Before ISD is reached â†’ Anticipated Load % = 1.0 (100%)

From ISD until 6 months after â†’ Anticipated Load % = 0.5 (50%)

Beyond 6 months from ISD â†’ Anticipated Load % = 0.0 (0%)


The anticipated load value is calculated as:

\text{Anticipated Load (kW)} = \text{Formalized Anticipated Load (kW)} \times \text{Anticipated Load %}

Example:

Suppose equipment wattage = 50 kW.

ISD = 31st August 2025.

Before 31st Aug 2025: Anticipated Load = 50 Ã— 1.0 = 50 kW

Between 31st Aug 2025 and 28th Feb 2026: Anticipated Load = 50 Ã— 0.5 = 25 kW

After 28th Feb 2026: Anticipated Load = 50 Ã— 0.0 = 0 kW




---

This makes it clear that the load value itself fluctuates depending on the ISD, because the percentage applied changes over time.

ðŸ‘‰ Do you want me to also draft a visual timeline diagram (for your PPT) showing these 3 phases â€” Pre-ISD (100%) â†’ 0â€“6 months post-ISD (50%) â†’ Beyond 6 months (0%) â€” so your team immediately understands the progression?

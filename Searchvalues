Here’s the Copilot prompt you can use to generate the full 938 HVAC zone records based on the two input files:

1️⃣ The sample HVAC holistic template (e.g., HVAC_windsor.csv)

2️⃣ The list of all locations (e.g., hvac.csv)

✅ Copilot Prompt to Use:

I have two CSV files:
1. One file is a sample HVAC holistic template (e.g., HVAC_windsor.csv) showing the correct column structure and example data.
2. The second file contains 938 locations (e.g., hvac.csv) in the format: LocationCode > RoomName (e.g., ALPRGAGQ > Battery room 2B).

I want you to generate a new HVAC holistic sheet that:
- Follows the same structure as the sample template.
- Creates one row per room (i.e., each row from the hvac.csv file).
- Extracts the LocationCode (before '>') as the site/location.
- For each site, if there are multiple rooms, generate incremental HVAC names like `HVAC-1 Placeholder`, `HVAC-2 Placeholder`, etc.
- Fill the following columns with default values:
  - Operation: ADD
  - Object: Cooling Unit
  - Make: Generic
  - Model: Generic HVAC
  - Status: Planned
  - Cooling Zone: leave blank for now
  - Compensation Factor: 100
  - Sensible Capacity (Tons): leave blank
  - Airflow Rate (CFM): leave blank
  - Redundancy: N+1
  - Installation Date: 1/1/1990
  - Custom Field HVAC Region Name: 499
  - Custom Field HVAC Sub Type: Unknown
  - Custom Field HVAC Type: Air Conditioner
  - Custom Field HVAC Sub Type Status: Active
  - Custom Field Percent for Zone: 100

Please generate the final table with 938 rows by combining the above logic. The "Location" column should match exactly what is in the location file (e.g., `ALPRGAGQ > Battery room 2B`). HVAC name should increment within each site group.

Once you upload both files to Copilot with this prompt, it will generate a final combined HVAC holistic sheet with accurate values and structure.

Let me know if you’d like this as an Excel formula-based transformation or Python code too.

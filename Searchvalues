To use Home Tasking Co-Pilot (likely GitHub Copilot or similar AI assistant) effectively for this task, hereâ€™s the exact prompt you can use to get it to compare the two files and append Area and Market Region from the CSV dump into the Excel sheet:


---

âœ… Suggested Prompt for Home Tasking Co-Pilot:

> "I have two files:

1. An Excel file (locations.xlsx) with a column Location UUID.


2. A CSV dump file (dump.csv) which contains Location UUID, Area, and Market Region.



Write a Python script using pandas that:

Loads both files.

Compares Location UUID in the Excel with the CSV.

Appends the matching Area and Market Region from the CSV to the Excel data.

Outputs a new Excel file with the additional columns."**

ðŸ§  If you're writing this yourself, hereâ€™s a sample Python code:

import pandas as pd

# Load the Excel file with location UUIDs
excel_df = pd.read_excel("locations.xlsx")

# Load the CSV dump with UUIDs, Area, and Market Region
csv_df = pd.read_csv("dump.csv")

# Merge both on Location UUID
merged_df = pd.merge(excel_df, csv_df[['Location UUID', 'Area', 'Market Region']], 
                     on='Location UUID', how='left')

# Save the result to a new Excel file
merged_df.to_excel("locations_with_area_market.xlsx", index=False)

Let me know if:

You want this in another language like Java or SQL.

Youâ€™d like the final output to be merged back into the original Excel file.

Or if you want help running this locally.

Thanks for the clarification — you're looking for a Copilot prompt to compare two Excel sheets and populate columns N and M in the new breaker sheet with the RPP mapping from the old breaker sheet, based on PDU name, but only for panel names that include "PANEL" (not "SPARE").

Here’s the exact prompt you can use in Copilot:

✅ Copilot Prompt to Populate RPP Columns Based on PDU and Panel Type

> I have two Excel sheets:

1. Old_Breaker_Sheet.csv
‣ This sheet contains columns like PDU Name, Connected RPP (Column N), and Panel Name.
‣ For each PDU, four breakers are created under a single panel, and RPPs are mapped to each breaker row.


2. New_Load_Panel_Breaker_Sheet.csv
‣ This sheet contains multiple rows per PDU, with panel names like PDU-A11-PANEL 1, PDU-A11-SPARE 1, etc.
‣ Columns N and M (RPP-related) are currently empty and need to be filled.



✅ What I need you to do:

For each row in New_Load_Panel_Breaker_Sheet.csv, check if the Panel Name (Column B) contains "PANEL" (not "SPARE").

Extract the PDU name from the panel name (e.g., from PDU-A11-PANEL 1, extract PDU-A11).

Find the first matching occurrence of that PDU name in the Old_Breaker_Sheet.csv (based on PDU Name column).

From the old sheet, take the value from Column N and Column M (RPP mappings), and copy them into the current row of the new sheet's Column N and Column M, respectively.

For rows where Panel Name contains "SPARE", leave Columns N and M blank.


✅ Output:

The updated version of New_Load_Panel_Breaker_Sheet.csv with Columns N and M populated wherever applicable.

Let me know if you want to script this in Python or Excel formulas as well.

Hi Ramana,

I connected with Suresh and collected the monthly login metrics.
Here is the update:

For October 2025, the IFP user logins were 2,269.

For November 2025, the logins have dropped to 1,542, which is approximately a 700-user decrease compared to October.


On the 1PSC side, the current active login count is around 231 users. This number has been stable — it was 231 a few days back and remains the same as of yesterday.

Attaching the gsheet snapshot for reference.

Please let me know if you need any additional breakdown or trend analysis.

If you want, I can also format a polished email version or create a one-line summary for your meeting.

Got it! Here's an updated version of your response that includes the context about testers having admin roles and adds a commitment to stronger validation and non-regression safeguards:

Thank you, Pat — that’s an important point and we truly appreciate you calling it out.

Upon review, we realized this issue was missed during testing because all our current testers have the Network Admin role by default. As a result, the edit icon appeared correctly for them, and the visibility issue for other workgroups went unnoticed.

To ensure this doesn’t happen again, we are taking the following steps:

1. ✅ Test Coverage for All Workgroups
We will now explicitly include test cases for non-admin workgroups as part of our QA process, so we can validate features from all user perspectives — not just admins.


2. 🧪 Role-Based Test Matrix in UAT
We’ll diversify tester profiles in UAT to simulate real-world access levels and uncover any hidden role-based issues early.


3. 🛡️ Regression Safeguards
For any code changes related to visibility or access, we’ll enforce a review of existing behavior to ensure nothing currently working is unintentionally broken.


4. 📋 Checklist Enhancement
We’ll update our internal test and release checklist to include cross-role validation for UI actions like edit, delete, or assign — especially where workgroup logic is involved.



Thanks again for your support — we’re making these changes immediately to strengthen our process and avoid such issues moving forward.

Let me know if you want to add the developer or QA team’s name at the end for accountability or escalation.

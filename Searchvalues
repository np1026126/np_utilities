Perfect â€” thanks for the detailed flow! Iâ€™ll lay this out as a flowchart diagram in text format (so you can paste into PPT, Lucidchart, Miro, or any diagramming tool).

Key Notes for Slide Explanation

Utility Feed â†’ Transformer: Normal AC input power.

Transformer â†’ ATS Switch: Primary supply line.

ATS Switch â†’ Generator: Backup power source in case transformer fails.

Generator â†’ ATS Switch: Feeds via fuel tanks (dependency).

ATS Switch â†’ AC Switch: Routes available power.

AC Switch â†’ DC Plant: Converts and passes power downstream.

DC Plant â†’ Plant Panel: Distribution point with breakers.

Plant Panel â†’ Rectifiers & Batteries: Ensures DC continuity and backup.

Plant Panel â†’ BDFB â†’ BDFB Panel: Final distribution stage before racks/equipment.

ðŸ‘‰ This structure is ready to paste into PPT or Lucidchart as a process flow diagram.

Do you want me to also simplify it into a one-slide visual layout with color-coded blocks (like: blue = AC side, orange = ATS/Generator redundancy, green = DC distribution)? That way your manager can quickly understand the split between AC and DC flows.

Below is a clean, complete, professional mail draft you can send to Jessica and team.
It covers:

✔ Their queries for Branchburg & Wall TWP site surveys
✔ Clarifications on each AC & DC asset (UPS, UPS Bank, Load Devices, PDU, PDU Panels, PDU Panel Breakers, RPP, RPP Panel Breakers, DC Plant Panel, DC Plant Panel Breakers, HVAC)
✔ Additional guidance similar to what you shared for New Berlin
✔ New instructions for Battery (with added columns for Make/Model fields)

You can copy-paste this directly.
If you want, I can also generate a PDF-style formatted version.

📧 Mail Draft to Jessica / Survey Team

Hi Jessica and team,

As you prepare to begin the Wall TWP and Branchburg site surveys, I have reviewed the questions raised on the existing PSC templates and prepared detailed clarification for each tab.
This should help ensure that the upcoming surveys are filled accurately and consistently across locations.

Along with this mail, I am also attaching:

The clarification document (per asset)

Updated AC & DC flow analysis (same format as the New Berlin analysis)

Sample templates for upstream assets (Utility Feed, Transformers, ATS / Main Switchboard, Load Devices)

Updated Battery template with new Make/Model fields

All reference templates used for the New Berlin validation


Below are the consolidated clarifications for all assets and template columns:


---

🔹 General Note – Location Name Column

Across all tabs, please ensure:

Do not fill “Location Name” unless you are certain.

If provided, use strictly: <CLLICODE> <space> <Room Name>
Example: NWBLWICZ Switch Room 1 100.
DC Track automatically derives this value from the Location* column, so incorrect entries may cause load issues.



---

AC ASSETS

1. UPS

What needs to be filled:

Status must be Planned or Installed (site survey had “False”).

Output Wiring: confirm if it is truly 3-wire; holistic template default is 4-wire + Ground, so please validate.

Custom Field “UPS Maintained By”: leave this blank.



---

2. UPS Bank

Required corrections:

Status must be Planned/Installed (not blank).

Naming convention:

If UPS is UPS A1, then UPS Bank should be UPSBank-A1.


Output wiring: verify whether 3-wire is correct.

Rating (Amps) must align correctly:

UPS Bank Rating A ≥ UPS KW rating, and

UPS Bank Rating A ≥ total load of PDUs fed from it.




---

3. Load Devices (UPS → UPS Bank & UPS Bank → PDU)

These were already fully described in yesterday’s clarification document.
Please continue using that guidance.
Load Devices should follow:

UPS → UPS Bank → Line Side = Extension, Load Side = Bus

UPS Bank → PDU → Line Side = Bus, Load Side = Extension

Naming convention:

For UPS to UPS Bank: UPSName BREAKER

For UPS Bank to PDU: PDUName BREAKER


Source format:
UPSBankName / <Load Device Name>



---

4. PDU

Two corrections required:

1. Power Fed From must be UPS Bank (not the UPS itself).


2. Source must follow:
UPSBankName / <Load Device Name>
The sample in the first screenshot of your message is the correct reference.




---

5. PDU Panel

Issues to correct:

Number of poles: 3 is acceptable, but since these are dummy panels, 6 poles is preferred.

Panel Layout: should generally be Two Column.

Pole Numbering:

If Two Column → use Odd/Even

If One Column → Sequential is fine.


First Pole Number: should be 1 for every panel (not 1, 7, 10, 4, etc.).

Panel Naming:

Panel 1 → PDU-A11 Panel 1

Panel 2 → PDU-A11 Panel 2

Pair 1 → PDU-A11 SPARE 1

Pair 2 → PDU-A11 SPARE 2




---

6. PDU Panel Breakers

Please apply the following:

Remove the incorrect row containing ATS → UPS connection.
PDUs never directly feed UPS, so this row should not exist.

If RPP is attached:

Object = Breaker to Panel


If no sub-panel location provided & status = open:

Object = Breaker to Others


Ensure the Panel name matches the corrected PDU Panel names above.



---

RPP ASSETS

7. RPP Panel

No changes required — the entries are correct.


---

8. RPP Panel Breakers

If Cabinet is attached AND state = Closed → Object = Breaker to Cabinet
(Additional cabinet columns will appear for such entries.)

If no cabinet attached or state is not closed → Object = Breaker to Others
Everything else looks fine.



---

DC ASSETS

9. DC Plant Panel & DC Plant Panel Breakers

These fields are mandatory since BDFB/BDFB Panels cannot be completed without specifying:
Plant / Plant Panel : Plant Panel Breaker
Please update these values wherever missing.


---

10. Load Devices for DC

Same logic as UPS/UPS Bank load devices.
Use the explanation document shared yesterday.


---

11. HVAC

Two mandatory fields missing in the site survey:

Cooling Zone Name

Sensible Capacity


Please ensure both fields are added for each HVAC unit.


---

12. Batteries

I have added additional Make/Model-specific fields to the end of the Battery template.
These values must be filled when a new vendor-specific make/model is used instead of GENERIC models.
I will share the updated file along with example entries for one location.


---

Next Steps & Attachments

In this email, I am attaching:

1. Clarification document (all AC + DC assets)


2. AC Flow – New Berlin Analysis


3. DC Flow – New Berlin Analysis


4. Updated Battery template with new columns


5. Templates for Utility Feed, Transformers, ATS/Switchboard, and Load Devices


6. Reference samples for UPS/UPS Bank, PDU, RPP, DC Plant, etc.



Please review and let me know if you would like to connect again live.
Happy to walk through all tabs before you begin the Branchburg and Wall TWP surveys.

Thanks,
Naveen

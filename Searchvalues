You are an expert in DC-TRAC integrations and API-based synchronization. 
I am integrating cabinets from a system called CND into DC-TRAC inventory. 
After initial migration, I need to set up a delta synchronization so that 
any new cabinets created or updated in CND automatically flow into DC-TRAC.

The DC-TRAC team provided a sample XML “Universal Connector” template 
(which shows where to configure GET API details), and the CND team 
shared their GET API contract for fetching cabinet details.

Your task is to:
1. Read and understand both files:
   - The sample XML connector template (provided by DC-TRAC)
   - The API contract document (provided by CND)
2. Based on the GET API URL, query parameters, and response structure 
   from the CND API contract, fill out the XML connector template properly 
   so that it can be imported into DC-TRAC.
3. Replace placeholders like server URL, polling interval, and API path 
   with the exact values from the CND API document.
4. Keep all comments in green as they are and replace all yellow placeholders 
   with correct, working values.
5. The resulting XML must be ready for import into DC-TRAC as a Universal Connector 
   to perform GET calls periodically and fetch cabinets created/updated 
   since the last run.

Here are the files to refer:
- File 1: DC-TRAC sample connector XML (Universal Connector example)
- File 2: CND DC-TRAC Delta API contract (includes GET URL, parameters, and JSON response example)

Based on these, generate the final XML file that can be directly imported 
into DC-TRAC to enable automatic cabinet delta synchronization.
Output only the completed XML file.

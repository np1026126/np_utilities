Got it—you want a step-by-step flow that you can copy into your testing document along with screenshots, so it reads like a proper test evidence process. Here's a detailed structured flow you can use:

AC Calculation and RPP Utilization – Test Steps

Step 1: Open the UNO PSE Assignment Screen

Navigate to the UNO PSE Assignment screen from the application menu.

Ensure that you are in the correct location/site context before proceeding.



---

Step 2: Select Power Input Type as AC

In the Power Info section, locate the Plant Type drop-down.

Select AC from the drop-down options.

Once selected, a pop-up window will open for RPP selection.


Screenshot Tip: Take a screenshot after selecting the AC option, capturing the pop-up.


---

Step 3: Choose RPP from the Pop-up

In the pop-up, a list of available RPPs for the selected location will be displayed.

Select the required RPP (e.g., RPP A11).

On selection, the corresponding RPP Panel details will open.


Screenshot Tip: Capture the list of RPPs shown and highlight the selected one.


---

Step 4: Select the RPP Panel

From the RPP details, select the specific RPP Panel associated with the chosen RPP.

The system will display calculations for RPP Panel, RPP, PDU, and UPS.


Screenshot Tip: Take a screenshot of the RPP panel selection window.


---

Step 5: Automatic A-Side to B-Side Mapping

Once the A-side (e.g., RPP A11) is selected:

The B-side (e.g., RPP B11) will automatically inherit the same value.

This mapping applies to PDU and UPS as well.


Verify that all B-side components display the same value as A-side.


Screenshot Tip: Capture the screen showing values on both A-side and B-side.


---

Step 6: View Anticipated Load

On the main screen, check the Anticipated Load section.

The system will display the anticipated load for all PSCs associated with the selected RPP, RPP Panel, and location.


Screenshot Tip: Take a screenshot showing the anticipated load values.


---

Step 7: Validate RPP Utilization Threshold

Check the RPP Utilization value displayed:

If the utilization > 80%, the system should automatically mark Work Required = Yes.

If ≤ 80%, Work Required = No.



Screenshot Tip: Highlight the utilization percentage and the Work Required field.


---

Step 8: Save and Update to DC Track

Once all validations are done, save the changes.

Verify that the calculated values are updated back to DC Track successfully.


Screenshot Tip: Capture the confirmation message or status update screen.


---

Step 9: Final Verification

Reopen the assignment screen to confirm that:

A-side and B-side values are retained correctly.

Anticipated load values match the calculations.

Work Required flag is as expected.

If you want, I can prepare a ready-to-use Word template with these steps so you can directly attach screenshots in the right places.

Do you want me to prepare that template for you? It will save you a lot of formatting time.

I’m working with data related to RPP (Remote Power Panels) which are classified under 'Floor PDU'. I’ve extracted data from multiple related tables using a SQL query. I’ve also provided the output CSV file and details of all the tables and their values used in the join.

The issue: The `Rating (kVA)` field is coming as 0 for all rows, which is incorrect.

I need your help to:
1. Analyze the provided query and related tables.
2. Calculate the correct `Rating (kVA)` using the available data (e.g., volts, amps, phase, or other electrical parameters).
3. If the calculated value is **0**, then **replace it with a default value of 300**.
4. Provide the updated logic/query or Python script that will generate the correct value for each asset.
5. Ensure the final output updates the `Rating (kVA)` column in the format used in the CSV.

**Attached data:**
- SQL query used for the output
- Related tables and sample values
- Output CSV result (showing `Rating (kVA)` as 0)

Make sure the fix works for assets like RPP-A121, RPP-A122, RPP-B121, and RPP-B122 shown in the result. Rating (kVA) must be calculated properly based on standard formulas or logic derived from the input data.

Perfect, Naveen — I’ve carefully gone through your screenshots and your detailed explanation. Here’s a clear and professional message you can send to users explaining how to fill in the “Load Devices” sheet for the UPS → UPS Bank and UPS Bank → PDU connections in the AC flow.

⚙️ Clarification on Filling Load Devices (UPS → UPS Bank / UPS Bank → PDU)

Hi Team,

Here’s the explanation on how to fill in the Load Devices section for the UPS and UPS Bank connections, as well as UPS Bank to PDU mapping. This is a critical part of the AC power chain formation in DC Track.

⚡ 1. UPS

The UPS represents the actual power backup equipment feeding downstream components.

For each UPS, provide:

Make & Model (e.g., Vertiv 600KVA EXL-S1)

KVA Rating, KW Rating, and Voltage (V) values

Location (Site → Room / Ceiling name)

Status (Planned / Installed)



This data defines where the UPS unit is physically located and what load it supports.


---

🔋 2. UPS Bank

For every UPS, there should be one corresponding UPS Bank.

The UPS Bank acts as the distribution point that receives power from the UPS.

The UPS Bank Rating (Amps) is derived from the UPS’s KW or KVA rating.

The UPS Bank also serves as the housing for Load Devices that connect the power flow between the UPS and PDU.

🔌 3. Load Devices

Load Devices represent the actual electrical connection path between the UPS, UPS Bank, and PDUs.
There are two main types of Load Devices in this context:

A. Load Device – UPS → UPS Bank

Purpose: Carries power from the UPS to its corresponding UPS Bank.

Line Side: Extension

Load Side: Bus

Power Fed From: The UPS itself.

Source: UPS Name : UPS Output

Device Name Convention: UPS Name + " Breaker" (e.g., UPS A1 Breaker).

Model: Load Device – 3 Pole.

Example Entry:

Power Fed From → UPS A1 : UPS Output

Line Side → Extension

Load Side → Bus A

Location → STLEMITX > UPS Room 303

Rating → 600 Amps



B. Load Device – UPS Bank → PDU

Purpose: Carries power from the UPS Bank to the Floor PDU.

Line Side: Bus

Load Side: Extension

Power Fed From: The UPS Bank output.

Source: UPS Bank Name : Output

Device Name Convention: PDU Name + " Breaker" (e.g., PDU B12 Breaker).

Model: Load Device – 3 Pole.

Example Entry:

Power Fed From → UPS Bank A : Output

Line Side → Bus A

Load Side → Extension

Location → STLEMITX > UPS Room 303

Rating → 600 Amps

🧩 Important Notes

Always ensure each UPS and UPS Bank pair has corresponding load devices defined in both directions (UPS → UPS Bank and UPS Bank → PDU).

Maintain consistent naming and rating formats as shown in the sample sheet.

The model for all load devices should remain “Load Device – 3 Pole.”


We’ve attached the sample sheet from the STLEMITX site to guide you on the expected structure and mapping pattern.

Would you like me to write a concise version (for Slack) of this same message, summarizing just the logic and conventions (UPS → UPS Bank and UPS Bank → PDU), to post along with your screenshot?

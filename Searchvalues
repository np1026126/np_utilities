Perfect — here’s your complete AC Flow correction summary (from UPS → UPS Bank → PDU → PDU Panel → PDU Panel Breakers → RPP Panel → RPP Panel Breakers → HVAC) written in a clean, professional format with consistent description and tabular comparison for direct copy-paste into your Slack update 👇

AC FLOW DATA CORRECTION SUMMARY


---

1. UPS

Description:
In the site survey, the Status column has incorrect values (e.g., “False”) instead of valid DCTrack statuses. It must be either Planned or Installed.
Additionally, the Output Wiring is shown as 3-wire whereas the holistic template default is 4-wire + Ground. This requires verification to confirm the correct wiring type.
The Custom Field – UPS Maintenance By column should remain blank (no value required).

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Status	False	Planned / Installed
Output Wiring	3-wire	4-wire + Ground (verify correctness)
Custom Field (UPS Maintenance By)	Value present	Leave Blank



---

2. UPS BANK

Description:
In the site survey, the Status column is empty; it should have either Planned or Installed.
The Naming convention for UPS Bank should follow: UPSBank-<UPSName> (same as UPS name with “Bank” suffix).
The Rating (Amps) of the UPS Bank must match the KW rating of UPS and be greater than the rating of PDUs connected to it.
Output wiring should be 3-wire, subject to cross-verification.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Status	Empty	Planned / Installed
Name	UPSBank (naming inconsistency)	UPSBank-<UPSName>
Output Wiring	3-wire (verify)	3-wire (if correct)
Rating (Amps)	Not validated	Must ≥ PDU rating and match UPS KW



---

3. PDU

Description:
The Power Fed From should be just “UPS Bank” (not the specific UPS Bank name).
The Source (UPS Bank / Load Device / PDU Panel:Breaker) format must follow the standard —
<UPSBankName>/<LoadDeviceName> (as shown in the first sample screenshot).
In the site survey, this format was not followed, and the power source reference (blue cell) is incorrect.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Power Fed From	UPSBank-A1	UPS Bank
Source	UPS-A1/LIEBERT EXM BDC:MIB	UPSBANK/PDU Breaker (e.g., UPSBANK-A/PDU-A11 BREAKER)



---

4. RPP

Description:
For RPP, Power Fed From must only refer to the PDU (not “Floor PDU” or other terms).
The Source should follow the format:
<PDU Name>/<PDU Panel>/<Breaker Positions>
Example: PDU-A11/PDU-A11 PANEL 1:3,5
Additionally, the Rating (Amps) needs confirmation — the provided value 800A seems high since typical RPP ratings are 400A–500A. This needs validation.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Power Fed From	Floor PDU	PDU
Source	PDU-A11/PANELBOARD 1:RPP-A111	PDU-A11/PDU-A11 PANEL 1:3,5
Rating (A)	800 (to verify)	Typically 400–500



---

5. PDU PANEL

Description:
Each PDU should have four panels created. The Number of Poles in site survey is given as 3, which is acceptable but can be set to 6 for dummy panels.
The Panel Layout is incorrectly given as One Column — it should be Two Column so that odd and even poles are split.
Pole Numbering must be either Odd/Even or Sequential.
First Pole Number should always start with 1 since each panel is independent.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Number of Poles	3	6 (optional)
Panel Layout	One Column	Two Column
Pole Numbering	Blank	Odd/Even or Sequential
First Pole Number	1 / 4 / 7 / 10	1 (for each panel)



---

6. PDU PANEL BREAKERS

Description:
An extra record “ATS → UPS” is present — this must be removed since PDU cannot connect directly to UPS.
When an RPP is attached (and Sub-Panel Location / Floor PDU is provided with Status = Closed), the Object must be Breaker to Panel.
If not attached and Status = Open, the Object must be Breaker to Others.
Additionally, the Panel Names need correction — all currently read PDU-A11 PANEL 1; they should be distributed as shown below.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Extra Row	ATS → UPS	Remove
Object	Breaker to Panel (for open breakers)	Breaker to Others
Panel Name	PDU-A11 PANEL 1 (for all)	PANEL 1, PANEL 2, PAIR 1, PAIR 2



---

7. RPP PANEL

Description:
No issues observed. The data in RPP Panel sheet is correct and consistent with the holistic template.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

All Fields	Correct	No Change Required



---

8. RPP PANEL BREAKERS

Description:
If a Cabinet is attached and Breaker Status = Closed, the Object should be Breaker to Cabinet.
If not attached or Status ≠ Closed, it should remain Breaker to Others.
For Breaker to Cabinet entries, a separate sheet must be used as it includes additional cabinet-related columns.

Field	Condition	Correct Object Value

Cabinet attached + Closed Status	Breaker to Cabinet	Use separate sheet (with extra columns)
No Cabinet / Not Closed	Breaker to Others	Existing data correct



---

9. HVAC

Description:
For HVAC units, two mandatory fields — Cooling Zone Name and Sensible Capacity — are missing in the site survey data.
These fields must be populated for DCTrack to compute correct thermal load associations and cooling zone mapping.

Field	Site Survey Data (Incorrect)	Holistic Data (Correct)

Cooling Zone Name	Blank	Must be filled (e.g., ZONE-1 / FLR1-ZONE-A)
Sensible Capacity	Blank	Must be filled (e.g., 52 kW / 177,000 BTU/hr)

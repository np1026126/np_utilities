Perfect clarification, Naveen 👌 — you’re absolutely right.
In both AC and DC power flows, there are two possible input paths into the Main Electrical Switchboard (ATS):

1. From the Utility Feed → Transformer → Switchboard, and


2. From the Fuel Tank → Generator → Switchboard,
where the ATS automatically switches between utility and generator power based on availability.



Here’s your final, refined version that clearly represents that logic visually 👇

⚙️ Clarification on Upstream Power Assets and Power-Chain Flow

Hi Team,

For upstream assets like Utility Feed, Transformers, Generators, ATS / Main Electrical Switchboards, and the Load Devices connecting these components, the data was not available in CPNG, IFP, or FUSE systems.
Hence, templates were not created earlier. We are now sharing sample templates for these assets so that you can populate them if the site data is available.

These assets are critical for establishing the complete AC and DC power-chain flow in DC Track.

Please use the attached templates to capture these upstream components wherever possible.
Once filled, we’ll validate and help integrate the data into DC Track.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a compact Slack version (with a single-line dual-source diagram for both flows) so you can share it in your migration channel with the template link?

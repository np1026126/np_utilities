Below is the clean, accurate, professionally-written explanation + sample table for the missing asset:

PDSA Distribution (AC Power Panel)

I looked at the screenshots you uploaded from DC-Track (Generic PDPSC / AC Distribution Power Panel), and based on how Sunbird DC-Track models AC Distribution Panels, here is the correct explanation:


---

✅ PDSA Distribution (AC Power Panel) – Explanation

1. “Order (L-R)” – What it means

Same meaning as other assets:

It indicates the physical sequence of AC Power Panels from Left → Right inside the electrical room or electrical line-up.

If there are multiple AC Distribution Panels in a lineup, they should be numbered in the order in which they appear physically:

Example:

Panel closest to the left wall = Order 1

Next panel to its right = Order 2

Next panel = Order 3



If only one panel is present, you can keep Order = 1.



---

✅ 2. Custom Field: Capacity

This field indicates the total power distribution capacity of the AC Power Panel.

Based on your DC-Track screenshot:

Capacity = 50

This value is typically:

kVA, if following electrical conventions

Or kW, depending on region (North America uses kVA more commonly for AC panels)


Since DC-Track does NOT specify units in the screenshot, Verizon teams usually keep the numeric value only (50), and the engineering team knows the units from their standard.

Example:
If the panel can distribute up to 50 kVA across its breakers, then:

Capacity = 50

If the user does not know the exact capacity, they can leave it blank, as it is NOT mandatory.


---

✅ 3. Custom Field: PDSE Amps

This field indicates the total amperage of the AC Distribution Panel, as per PDSE (Power Distribution System Equipment) specification.

In your screenshot:

PDSE Amps = 0

However, typically for AC Power Panels, this might be:

100A

225A

400A

600A


But since this was filled as 0 in the DC-Track screenshot, the field appears to be optional and not validated.

So the users can:

Provide the amperage rating if known

Else leave it as 0 or blank



---

✅ 4. Custom Field: Quantity

This field shows the number of modules or sections inside the AC Distribution Panel.

In your screenshot:

Qty = 0

Typical meaning:

If the panel has multiple sections or breaker modules, Quantity identifies the count.

For example:

A panel with two breaker sections → Qty = 2

A panel with one section → Qty = 1



Since the screenshot shows 0, again it appears optional.

If they don't know the exact value, they may leave it as 0.


---

✨ Summary of What Users Should Enter

If they know exact AC panel details → enter actual capacity, PDSE amps, quantity.

If not available → leave the field blank or use a default (0), similar to what is shown in the DC-Track screenshot.

📘 Tabular Format – PDSA Distribution (AC Power Panel)

Field Name	Meaning	Example	Notes

Order (L-R)	Physical order of AC Distribution Panels from left to right	1, 2, 3	Use sequential numbering based on lineup.
Capacity (Custom Field)	Total load capacity of the AC Power Panel (usually in kVA or kW)	50	Optional. If unknown, leave blank.
PDSE Amps (Custom Field)	Total amperage rating of the panel	400, 600, 200	Optional. 0 is acceptable if unknown.
Quantity (Custom Field)	Number of internal modules/sections	1, 2	Optional. 0 accepted.

👍 If you want, I can also prepare:

✔ A combined PDF-like text for all AC + DC assets
✔ A final document to send to Jessica (in clean, formatted form)
✔ A Slack message summary
✔ A version with screenshots embedded references

Just tell me “Give combined version” and I will prepare everything in one single file.

Got it. So you want the message to explain clearly that:

The Anchorage site data was re-uploaded.

The data might have been deleted because the team was using the same site for both testing and as a sample for migrating other assets.

You’ll ensure it won’t be used again by anyone else so this doesn’t repeat.


Here’s a polished version you can send to the users:

Message Draft

> Hi [User Name/Team],

The data for the Anchorage site has now been re-uploaded. Apologies for the inconvenience — it looks like the team was using the same site not only for testing purposes but also as a sample reference for migrating other assets. This could be one of the reasons the data got unknowingly deleted in the process.

Moving forward, I’ll ensure this site is kept dedicated so that no one else uses it for testing or migration work, and the data remains intact for your needs.

You can now proceed with your testing as the data is fully available again.

If you want, I can make a shorter version for a quick Slack reply and a slightly formal version for email. Which one do you prefer?

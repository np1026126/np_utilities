Discussion Queries for Busway Enablement (UNO / DC-Track)

1. Feasibility & Representation

1. Is it possible to create a Busway in DC-Track as a functional equivalent of a Floor PDU / RPP?


2. If the Busway is created as a Panel (for example, “Busway Panel”) under the Floor PDU, how will it appear in the power chain?

Will the one-line diagram differ from the normal RPP flow?

Should it visually remain under the Floor PDU, or should it appear as a new distribution segment?

2. Location-Specific Implementation

3. For the four sites—Roseville, Plainfield, Westside, and Tampa—that have only Busways (no RPPs):

Should these Busways be the default selection shown to users in UNO when they create PSE requests?

Should UNO automatically filter and show “Busway” instead of “RPP” for these locations?

3. Tap-Box and Cabinet Connectivity

4. How should cabinets be associated with a Busway Tap Box?

In DC-Track, can an existing cabinet be connected to a Busway Tap Box outlet directly (similar to panel breaker mapping)?

Should this connection be created manually or through automation during migration?



5. When a user creates a new Busway and Tap Box in UNO/DC-Track, what is the expected process to link the existing cabinet to that Busway?

4. Tap-Box Capacity Modeling

6. Currently, each Tap Box in DC-Track UI supports only 16 poles, but IFP data shows up to 64 poles per Tap Box for some Busways.

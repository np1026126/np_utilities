Here are two MVP features you can create (clear title + scope + acceptance criteria). I’m splitting them so the first “feature” covers the re-run automation across SIT/UAT/PLE, and the second covers floor-name changes in ELS and sync to DC Track.
Feature 1: Re-run Site View Script Generation & Execution (SIT/UAT/PLE)
Goal
After floor changes are completed, re-generate the Site View migration scripts and execute them in SIT, UAT, and PLE to refresh Site View data consistently.
Scope / What it includes
Trigger/option to re-generate scripts for a given site (or list of sites).
Execute Site View scripts in SIT → UAT → PLE (sequence can be manual or controlled).
Logging + evidence: execution status, output counts, errors, and timestamps per environment.
Ability to re-run safely without duplicating/creating conflicts (idempotency or cleanup strategy).
Out of scope (for MVP, if you want to keep it small)
Fully automated rollback across environments.
Full scheduling / Airflow orchestration (unless already existing).
Auto-detection of “floor changes done” (you can keep it user-triggered).
Acceptance Criteria
User can provide Site ID / CLLI / Site code (whatever your key is) and select envs (default all 3).
System regenerates scripts successfully and stores them with a run identifier.
System executes scripts in each selected environment and shows:
SUCCESS / FAILED
execution start/end time
error snippet if failed
summary counts (e.g., floors/rooms/relationships updated)
Re-running for the same site does not create duplicate site view structures (or it first cleans up previous run data based on a defined strategy).
Deliverables
Re-run endpoint/CLI/job with parameters: site key, target envs, “regen only” vs “regen + execute”.
Run report (table/log) per environment.
Feature 2: Floor Name Change Support in ELS + Sync to DC Track (Site View Migration)
Goal
When floor names are updated in ELS, the updated floor naming must be synced to DC Track so Site View migration remains consistent and accurate.
Scope / What it includes
Ability to update floor names in ELS (source of truth) with validation rules.
Mapping rules to identify the correct floor record (avoid wrong matches).
Sync mechanism to DC Track:
Push updated floor name(s)
Ensure Site View representation reflects the new name
Auditability:
Track old name → new name
Who changed it, when, and status of DC Track sync.
Key Behaviors
If a floor name is changed in ELS, DC Track should reflect it without breaking relationships/site view hierarchy.
Handle collisions (two floors ending up with same name) with a clear error.
Handle “floor not found in DC Track” with a clear status and remediation note.
Acceptance Criteria
Given a floor in ELS, user can change its name (via UI/API/DB update path you already use).
Sync job/API updates DC Track floor name for the same floor entity.
After sync:
DC Track shows the updated name in Site View
No duplicate floor entities are created in DC Track
A sync report is generated: UPDATED / SKIPPED / FAILED with reason.
Deliverables
ELS floor rename flow (API/service + validation).
DC Track sync component (API integration) with retry and failure logging.
Audit log table/record or log output that can be attached to tickets.
If you want, I can also format these into Jira-ready stories (Summary, Description, AC, Dependencies, Risks) with a crisp MVP definition and a “done” checklist.

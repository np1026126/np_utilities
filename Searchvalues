Here’s a clean and professional way to write your Slack message:

Slack Message Draft:

Hi [Name],
As requested, for the 6 sites, we are sharing all the assets in the holistic template format.
By end of today, we’ll provide:

The data that has been imported into DC Track for all 6 locations (for site survey reference) in the provided link.

The holistic template that was originally shared by your team.


Both the data file and the holistic template will be available in the shared link once the upload is complete.

Would you like me to make it slightly more formal (for a senior stakeholder) or more conversational (for a peer)?

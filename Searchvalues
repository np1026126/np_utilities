Got it. You need a clear, professional reply explaining why 1 cooling zone was not added, confirming what was added, and what is needed from them to proceed.
Below is a ready-to-send Slack / email response you can use (polished but firm, no blame).

✅ Suggested Reply (Professional & Clear)

> Hi Peter,

We reviewed the MSC Laser site cooling zones based on the HVAC zone sheet provided by the users.

Out of the 6 cooling zones listed:

5 cooling zones have already been added successfully.

The 6th cooling zone was not added because its Sensible Capacity value is 0 in the provided data.


As per system rules, a cooling zone cannot be created with a sensible capacity of 0, so we are unable to add that specific zone with the current values.

Apart from this one case, all other applicable cooling zones from the sheet have been built. The remaining entries are marked as “Do Not Add” in the source sheet.

If the correct sensible capacity values are provided for the missing cooling zone, we can proceed with adding it immediately.

For reference, here is the HVAC zone sheet link shared earlier by the users:
👉 [Paste HVAC zone sheet link here]

Please let us know once the updated values are available, and we’ll take it forward.

Thanks.

🔹 If you want a shorter Slack version

> Hi Peter,

We checked the MSC Laser cooling zones from the HVAC sheet provided.

✅ 5 out of 6 zones are already added.
❌ The remaining zone has Sensible Capacity = 0, so it cannot be created in the system.

All other entries are marked “Do Not Add” in the sheet.

If updated cooling capacity values are shared for the missing zone, we can add it right away.

Thanks.

🔹 Key points this reply clearly establishes

✅ Confirms work is already done
✅ Explains the constraint (system rule, not judgment)
✅ Puts the action back on them (provide values)
✅ Shares evidence source (HVAC sheet)
✅ Keeps tone factual, not defensive

If you want, I can also:

Add screenshots reference wording

Rewrite this as a ticket update

Make it more strict/firm or more friendly


Just tell me 👍

Below is a polished, complete, Workday-ready “Operational Excellence” content, created by combining:

✔ Whatever you already wrote in the comment box
✔ New points you told me verbally
✔ The expectations shown in the Description (SLA, SRE, MTTR, Tier-1/2/3, AYS reduction, security, access, clearance, production support, etc.)
✔ Your actual contributions in migration + production + AWS ticket reduction + defects + collaboration

I am giving this in a clean, professional, copy-paste-ready format, exactly suitable for Workday.

⭐ Operational Excellence – Employee Comment

(Full, Final Version)

Consistently drove operational excellence by adhering to SLA expectations across Tier-1, Tier-2, and Tier-3 teams, actively engaging with them to ensure stability, timely deployments, and production readiness. I worked very closely with Meghna’s Tier-2 and Tier-3 teams on a regular cadence (every alternate day) to triage data-related issues, prioritize them correctly, provide clarifications, and ensure fixes were delivered with minimal turnaround time. This significantly reduced rework, improved MTTR, and ensured minimal disruption to users.

Enabled smoother production support cycles by validating code changes, coordinating with deployment teams, and ensuring all configuration changes were correctly implemented before deployment. Actively supported data corrections, validations, and pre-checks for every major and minor release, resulting in more predictable and safer production deployments.

Worked cross-functionally with SRE teams to ensure reliability standards were met and followed across services, especially during the AC-flow release and the migration activities. Ensured adherence to SR policies, including correct tagging, improved visibility, and following observability practices across modules.

Addressed multiple Backlog/Vulnerability items by partnering with SRE & Security teams, ensuring that required security fixes were completed within expected timelines and stayed well within the organizational risk appetite (GREEN Zone). Supported AWS ticket reduction by closely collaborating with Meghna and her team, analyzing repeating issues, validating root causes, and helping reduce recurring AYS tickets significantly over the last six months.

Proactively validated AYS tickets for multiple services, ensured correct ownership assignment (MTZ/TLS/Product teams), and supported Tier-2/Tier-3 teams with real-time clarifications to avoid unnecessary ticket escalations. This helped ensure fixes were implemented in a timely manner with zero dependency bottlenecks.

Enabled operational continuity for business-critical users by handling production queries raised by user groups, providing clarifications on system behavior, helping them understand the impact, and enabling them to proceed with minimal delays. This ensured high user satisfaction and improved stability across modules.

As part of migration and AC/HVAC calculation enhancements, ensured stability by performing early integration testing, maintaining quality of delivered stories, and fixing issues before they impacted production. Tracked progress across modules, monitored defect patterns, and collaborated with the right teams to reduce recurring defects and ensure compliance.

These combined efforts strengthened platform reliability, reduced recurring issues, enhanced cross-team efficiency, and supported business continuity with a strong focus on SLA adherence, defect reduction, MTTR improvement, and zero major production disruptions.

If you want, I can also format it exactly in a single line, multi-line, or bullet point style to match the Workday box.
If you want, I can also shorten this, convert to bullet points, or rewrite it in a stronger leadership tone.

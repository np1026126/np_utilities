Got it. I can help you extend the same Excel structure to include Task 5 with two subtasks for Sameer, just like the previous tasks.

Here’s how the Task 5 details would look in the same format:


---

Task 5 Details

Task ID	Task Name	Subtask ID	Subtask Description	Assignee	Progress (%)

T5	Work Summary Calculator	T5.1	Fetch the data for UPS, PDU, RPP, Generator, and HVAC from DC Track and calculate the work summary values	Sameer Chachiya	0
		T5.2	Display the calculated summary values in the UI for further processing and analysis	Sameer Chachiya	0



---

This keeps the structure consistent with your existing sheet:

Task Name: High-level task description.

Subtask Description: Specific actionable items.

Assignee: Sameer is handling both subtasks.

Progress (%): Starts at 0 until work begins.



---

If you want, I can help you:

1. Add Task 5 directly into a downloadable Excel file so you can merge it with your existing sheet.


2. Or provide the copy-paste ready version so you can directly update your current Google Sheet

Got it. Based on the screenshot and the details you’ve shared earlier, here’s how we can structure the main tasks and two subtasks each for Mahira, Manasa, and Sudiksha in the same way as you used for Sameer:


---

Task Details in Structured Format

Task for Mahira

Task ID	Task Name	Subtask ID	Subtask Description	Assignee	Progress (%)

T6	Anticipated Load Editing & Update	T6.1	Edit anticipated load in UNO and Cyrus tables for given RPP IDs	Mahira	0
		T6.2	Update latest anticipated load values in PSE Calculation Table and asynchronously update DC Track	Mahira	0



---

Task for Manasa

Task ID	Task Name	Subtask ID	Subtask Description	Assignee	Progress (%)

T7	HVAC Calculation & Anticipated Load	T7.1	Populate HVAC calculation values for Wireless sites in Anticipated Load Table	Manasa	0
		T7.2	On submit, auto-populate anticipated load table values and asynchronously update DC Track	Manasa	0



---

Task for Sudiksha

Task ID	Task Name	Subtask ID	Subtask Description	Assignee	Progress (%)

T8	Display RPP & RPP Panel Values in UI	T8.1	Fetch RPP and RPP panel values in UNO and display UPS Bank, RPP, and Panel Values in PSE Request Details Table	Sudiksha	0
		T8.2	On RPP/RPP Panel selection, display all calculated values from Mahira & Manasa modules on UI for user reference	Sudiksha	0



---

This keeps everything consistent with your previous task sheets:

Main Task → High-level objective

Subtask 1 & 2 → Clear and actionable steps

Assignee & Progress → For tracking and responsibility



---

If you want, I can prepare this in Excel format with the same column structure you used earlier so you can directly upload it to your Google Sheet.

Do you want me to create a ready-to-upload Excel file for this?

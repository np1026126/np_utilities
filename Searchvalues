Here’s a status update draft you can post in the user’s Slack channel. It’s worded in a clear, professional way that explains your current progress without sounding like “no progress,” but instead showing structured activity:

Migration Status Update – [Date]

We have started segregating all assets across the 150 target sites (currently data is available for 147 sites).

As of now, we have identified a total of 152 distinct asset types (covering both AC and DC assets).

Migration activity is in progress, and we are organizing the assets site-wise before beginning the actual load into DCTrack.

Current focus: building the mapping framework so that the migration can proceed consistently across all sites.


Next steps:

Complete segregation for all 147 available sites.

Prepare the migration scripts and templates for DCTrack.

Share an updated progress summary after the first batch migration run.

Got it 👍 — here’s a polished version of your Slack migration status update with the details you mentioned:

Migration Status Update – [Date]

We have identified a total of 22 assets across the sites.

The mapping chain has been built and linked for all 22 assets.

Migration progress so far:

7 assets fully migrated

8th asset currently in progress and expected to be completed shortly


Next, we will continue importing the remaining assets sequentially to complete the migration scope.

👉 This version is short, clear, and gives a sense of steady progress while showing that work is structured.

Do you also want me to make this look more visual for Slack (like adding checkmarks ✅ for completed, 🔄 for in-progress, ⏳ for pending) so that it’s easier for managers and users to digest at a glance?

👉 This way, you’re showing the manager and users that while “actual migration load” hasn’t started yet, you are progressing on data preparation and structuring, which is a critical prerequisite.

Do you want me to also prepare a visual progress tracker (like a simple bar chart or table) that you can paste in Slack to show % completion (e.g., sites segregated vs. total, assets identified vs. total)? That often looks more convincing in these updates.

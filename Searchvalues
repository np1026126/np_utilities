> Thanks, Arup.
This particular BDFB was actually added as part of the CPNG data. In CPNG, it is associated with a different room, since the users had mentioned that location as ROOF.

The reason it was missed out from IFP is because our earlier query logic was designed to identify BDFBs based on the name or description containing keywords such as BDFB, BDCBB, PECB, etc. For certain assets where the EduName contained only numbers and no such identifiers, those records were not captured in the IFP extract.

We have now identified a way to extract such records — even when only numeric names are present — by using the view-based query. I have already provided the updated query for this correction.
Suresh has pulled out the data using this updated logic and is currently cross-verifying all the records to ensure that the numeric-only entries are also included accurately.

Would you like me to add one closing line like:

> “Once verification is completed, we’ll rerun and share the updated results for this location.”
It’ll make the message sound complete from a status perspective.

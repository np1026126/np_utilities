Subject: Migration of Cabinets, WIPs, and Breaker Mapping for Budget Load Update

Hi Suresh,

As we proceed with the budget load update at the cabinet level for the soft launch, I wanted to confirm the dependencies for cabinet and WIP migration.

Key Points:

1. Cabinet Migration:

We are migrating the cabinets into DC Track so that anticipated load, current load, and reserve load can be maintained directly at the cabinet level.



2. WIP Migration & Mapping:

When breaker assignment type is set as Cabinet, DC Track expects WIP connector details (position and location).

This means that along with cabinet migration, WIPs also need to be migrated and correctly mapped to both cabinets and breakers.



3. Requirement for Budget Load Update:

For the budget load data update to work seamlessly at the cabinet level, we need:

Cabinets migrated into DC Track.

WIPs migrated and linked with the cabinets.

Breakers correctly assigned to cabinets via WIP connectors.





Request:

Could you confirm if the migration of WIPs along with cabinets and the assignment of breakers to cabinets via WIP will be handled as part of the upcoming migration activities? This is essential for completing the budget load update at the cabinet level before the soft launch.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also prepare a Slack version of this so you can quickly update Suresh informally. Do you want me to prepare that as well?

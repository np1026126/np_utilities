Here is your refined Co-Pilot prompt that directly follows your pointer:


---

✅ Co-Pilot Prompt – Replace Floor PDU & Location with Standardized RPP Naming


---

Prompt:

> I am uploading a CSV file that has two columns of interest:

Floor PDU (e.g., RPP A112, RPP-A112, RPP_A112)

Location (e.g., Panel A, Panel B, Panel 1, Panel 2)


I also have a mapping logic from another text file that looks like this:

PDU-A11 → RPP-A111-SECTION1, RPP-A112-SECTION2  
PDU-A21 → RPP-A211-SECTION1, RPP-A212-SECTION2  
PDU-B11 → RPP-B111-SECTION1, RPP-B112-SECTION2  
(and so on...)

I want you to:

1. Replace the values in the Floor PDU column with the corresponding PDU name (e.g., PDU-A11) based on the RPP name it maps to.

For example, if the row has RPP-A112, then Floor PDU should be updated to PDU-A11.



2. Replace the Location column to show the standardized RPP name, matching the correct section number:

If original Floor PDU is RPP-A112 and Location is Panel A or Panel 1, update it to RPP-A112-SECTION1

If it is Panel B or Panel 2, update to RPP-A112-SECTION2

Ensure all variations like panel a, Panel A, Panel 1 are normalized



3. Clean formatting in both columns:

Remove unwanted spaces

Convert underscores _ to hyphens -

Capitalize section names consistently (SECTION1, SECTION2)



4. Generate a new CSV file with updated values for Floor PDU and Location.



Here's a clear and complete prompt you can use with Co-Pilot or any automation tool to clean and structure your data correctly based on your screenshots and naming convention logic:

✅ Co-Pilot Prompt – Normalize and Rename RPP Panel Names


---

Prompt:

> Based on the screenshots and the data structure provided:

1. Use the PDU–RPP mapping from the first screenshot (plant_fallout_changes.txt) to understand the parent-child structure between Floor PDUs and RPPs.

Each PDU (like PDU-A11) maps to multiple RPPs (like RPP-A111-SECTION1, RPP-A112-SECTION2, RPP-A413-SECTION3).



2. In the Panel Excel CSV screenshot (second image), under the Floor PDU and Location columns:

The current names like RPP A112, RPP-A112, RPP_A112, Panel A, Panel 1, Panel B, etc., are inconsistent.

Normalize all RPP names to the format:
RPP-<PDU Code><Panel Number>-SECTION<Section Number>
For example:

RPP-A112 with Panel A → RPP-A112-SECTION1

RPP-A112 with Panel B → RPP-A112-SECTION2

RPP-A413 with Panel C → RPP-A413-SECTION3




3. Fix spacing/hyphen/underscore inconsistencies in the Floor PDU column. Ensure:

No spaces inside RPP name (e.g., RPP A112 → RPP-A112)

Use hyphens consistently



4. Add a new column Standardized Panel Name to reflect the corrected names.


5. Apply this logic to all rows consistently and output a new cleaned version of the CSV.

Let me know if you want me to generate a sample Python script or Excel formula/Power Query to automate this renaming process.

Let me know if you’d like to automate this in Excel (Power Query), Python, or any other method – I can generate that for you as well.

Here’s a clear and professional Slack message you can send to Sudha explaining the DC-TRAC cabinet statuses —

Slack Message Draft:

> Hi @Sudha,

In DC-TRAC, we have the following cabinet/asset statuses — Planned, Installed, and Archived.

Planned – This indicates that the asset is not yet available for use. It represents equipment that is planned to be placed in a specific location, with the required details captured, but not yet physically installed or active.

Installed – This means the asset is live and available for operational use.

Archived – This status is used for decommissioned or retired assets that are no longer in use.


Hope this helps clarify the meaning of the statuses in DC-TRAC.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make it sound a little more conversational (for the chat thread) or keep it in this formal explanatory tone?

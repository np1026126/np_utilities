For this integration with the UCS system via an API, your goal is to automate the sync of SNMP OID and IP address changes when new DC power plants are added or updated in your system.

Here‚Äôs a detailed message (and set of questions) you can send to the UCS team to initiate the conversation clearly and professionally:

‚úÖ Feature Summary

Data migration of PNG (Power & Network Gear) inventory from source systems IFP, CPNG, and FUSE into DC-Track for a total of 54 CAP sites. This feature enables streamlined asset integration by consolidating all critical equipment records under DC-Track for centralized visibility, validation, and operational readiness.

üìå Acceptance Criteria (AC)

AC No.	Acceptance Criteria

AC1	Regenerate DC-Track-ready holistic templates for 8 key PNG asset types including UPS, PDU, RPP, Panels, HVAC, Generators, ATS, and CRAC.
AC2	For each of the 54 CAP sites, perform end-to-end migration steps from staging to production DC-Track environments.
AC3	Validate asset data quality and completeness prior to production migration.
AC4	Handle fallouts by creating or updating missing/mismatched asset data including Make, Model, and Type as per DC-Track standards.
AC5	Migrate validated sites into Alien environment for review and approval from site owners.
AC6	Upon user validation, promote successfully validated sites into Production.
AC7	Capture and log all data issues, transformation logic, and mapping decisions for audit readiness.
AC8	Update tracking dashboard with real-time progress per site and asset category.

üì© Draft Mail / Discussion Points to UCS Team

Hi [UCS Team / Contact Name],

Hope you're doing well.

As part of our upcoming DC6 enhancements, we are planning to automate the process of updating SNMP OID and IP address details of DC power plants with the UCS system. Currently, this communication is manual, but we are looking to move towards an API-based integration.

üéØ Use Case Summary

When users add or update a DC power plant in our application (e.g., changing SNMP OID or IP address),

We want to automatically notify UCS via an API call, so that UCS has the most recent configuration for SNMP polling.


‚ùì We have a few questions to check feasibility:

1. Do you already have an API exposed to:

Add a new power plant with SNMP OID and IP address?

Update SNMP OID or IP address for an existing power plant?



2. If yes:

Can you please share the API specification or Swagger/OpenAPI details?

Are there any authentication mechanisms required (e.g., API keys, OAuth)?

What would be the expected request format and mandatory fields?

Is there a rate limit or daily quota on how many updates we can push?



3. If not:

Is there a plan or story in your backlog for exposing such an API?

What would be the estimated timeline for availability?

Is there any interim workaround you recommend until the API is available?



4. Is there any callback or validation mechanism (like a response payload or error code) to confirm that an update is successful on your end?


5. Should we consider any whitelisting of our server IP or security constraints before calling your API?

Please let us know your inputs so we can plan this integration accordingly for our next release.

Thanks,

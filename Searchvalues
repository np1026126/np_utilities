Here’s a more detailed, professional Slack update that expands on what you said, so users and managers clearly see both what’s been achieved and what’s next:

Migration Status Update – [Date]

As part of the migration effort, we first segregated all the 22 identified asset types across the sites. For these 22 assets, we have completed the following foundational work:

Mapping completed for all 22 assets:

Built the mapping chain between floor space banks and UPS

Connected UPS → UPS Bank → Floor PDU by forming the required load devices

Defined the plant panel structures and their associated breakers to support power distribution consistency

Established the linkage rules that ensure end-to-end power chain integrity across the hierarchy


Migration progress so far:

7 assets have been fully migrated into DC Track successfully

The 8th asset is currently in progress and on track for completion

Remaining assets will be migrated sequentially following the same validated mapping and import process


Next steps:

Continue migration for the pending assets in batches

Validate end-to-end power chain flows post-migration to ensure downstream calculations (anticipated load, utilization, etc.) are working as expected

👉 This way you’re showing that:

1. You’ve already standardized the mapping across all 22 assets (big milestone).


2. Actual migration work is progressing in a structured manner (7 done, 1 in progress, rest queued).


3. Users know what to expect next.



Do you want me to also make a visual variant of this (with emojis or checkmarks ✅ 🔄 ⏳) so that in Slack, it looks lighter and quickly scannable for non-technical readers?

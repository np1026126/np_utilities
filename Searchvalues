üìå Subject: DC-Track Upload Issues for Windsor Site ‚Äì Action Required

Dear Team,

During the DC-Track data validation and pre-migration process for the Windsor site, the following issues were identified across multiple asset types. These need to be addressed in order to proceed with successful data import and ensure system integrity.


---

üîß General Observations:

1. UPS and Floor PDU Mismatch

The UPS units provided have lower KW/KVA ratings compared to the connected Floor PDUs and RPPs.

For instance, UPS-A1 with 54.8 KW and 55.6 KVA is connected to PDUs rated at 225 KVA, which is not technically feasible.

Action: Please verify the UPS capacity and ensure it aligns with the load requirements of all connected PDUs.



2. Missing Power Chain Data

For proper power chain flow and accurate asset linking, the following information is mandatory:

UPS Bank association for each UPS.

Load Device details associated with each UPS.

Power-fed source for Floor PDUs, referencing the appropriate UPS/UPS Bank.


Action: Please include the complete upstream and downstream power mapping (UPS ‚Üí UPS Bank ‚Üí Load Device ‚Üí Floor PDU).

‚ö†Ô∏è Asset-Specific Issues:

1. Battery

Belongs To field must reference either a valid UPS or Plant name.

The following fields are required for each battery:

Capacity 1 Rate (Hours), Capacity 1 (Ah)

Capacity 2 Rate (Hours), Capacity 2 (Ah)


String Number and Index String must be clearly specified to establish plant-level connectivity.


2. Plant

Generic Plant Model is being rejected as it doesn't meet standard DC-Track requirements.

Multiple custom fields like "Owner of this Record", "Last Polled", and "Anticipated Update" are incorrectly formatted or repeated.


3. Plant Bay / Rectifier

Location values must follow the format: <CLLI Code> <Space> <Room Name>

Some rectifier locations are missing or incorrectly named.


4. BDFB / BDFB Panel

Row label issues exist where rack position (U position, Orientation) and Rails Used fields are either missing or repeated.

Dummy entries like ‚Äú99999‚Äù used in Power Fed From must be replaced with correct source references.

Source and Source Location fields must conform to the acceptable DC-Track format.


5. Generator

Make field should start with a capital letter as per the naming conventions.

üìÖ Next Steps:

We request your assistance in:

Verifying and correcting the UPS-PDU power mapping.

Providing complete power chain references (UPS ‚Üí Bank ‚Üí Load Device ‚Üí PDU).

Rectifying the listed field errors and formatting issues for each asset type.


This will help us proceed smoothly with the UAT migration phase and ensure data is production-ready.

Please let us know once the revised data is available for revalidation.

Best regards,

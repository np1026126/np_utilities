Here is the ticket content for raising the third issue to Sunbird â€” about missing kW/kVA phase-wise readings at the PDU level, just like what's shown for RPP in your screenshot.

âœ… Ticket Title / Summary:

Enable Real-Time Phase-Wise kW/kVA Readings at PDU Level


---

ðŸ“Œ Description:

Currently, in the dcTrack UI, the real-time power utilization readings â€” such as kW, kVA, and per-phase consumption (Phase A, B, and C) â€” are displayed only at the Remote Power Panel (RPP) level, as shown in the attached screenshot.

However, these details are not available at the PDU (Power Distribution Unit) level. This limits our ability to analyze and manage PDU utilization, especially for accurate load balancing, capacity planning, and real-time monitoring.

To align with the electrical one-line diagram expectations and ensure proper visibility into power flows, we request that similar kW/kVA phase-wise metrics (actual vs budgeted values, utilization %, and phase-wise load) be made available at the PDU level as well.

This enhancement is essential for:

Accurate visualization of power consumption along AC flows

Better decision-making for electrical planning

Consistency with RPP views already available in dcTrack

Let me know if you'd also like a version for internal tracking or a shorter version for the ticket title field.

Subject: Clarifications on Existing PSC Templates & Updated Files for Wall TWP and Branchburg

Hi Jessica,

I have reviewed all the questions raised on the existing PSC templates and prepared detailed clarifications for each tab. These clarifications will help ensure that the upcoming surveys for Wall TWP and Branchburg are completed accurately.

Along with the clarifications, I am also attaching the updated Wall TWP and Branchburg circuit details that we have already imported into DCTrack.
Instead of using the older holistic templates, you may now use these updated files since they contain the actual validated asset data that was successfully loaded into DCTrack for both locations.

For each location, the following documents are included:

AC Flow Analysis (separate file)

DC Flow Analysis (separate file)

Updated circuit details extracted directly from DCTrack


These should be used as the baseline reference for how data should be filled during the new surveys.

Additional Templates for Upstream Assets

I have also added sample templates for the following upstream assets:

Utility Feeds

Transformers

ATS / Main Switchboards

Load Devices connecting the Switchboards

Equipment Cabinets (Cabinet Imports)

Cabinet Assets


These assets were not included in the main PSC template, because they are not available in any of the three source systems (CPNG, IFP, or FUSE).
The sample data I included for these assets comes from the Lahser site survey (not from Wall TWP or Branchburg). These are strictly reference samples to help the vendors understand the expected structure.

If the teams are able to capture these upstream and cabinet-related assets during the Wall/Branchburg surveys, that would be ideal.
If this data is not available at the site, that is still completely fine—we can continue the import and proceed with the AC/DC mapping without it.

Please let me know if you would like me to walk through the files or any of the clarification points over a quick call.

Thanks,
Naveen

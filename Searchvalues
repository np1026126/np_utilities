Hi Shivanandhi,

I have completed the cleanup for the DEV schema for most of the modules, including UNO Services and Raftex Services under Cyrus. However, a few tables are still pending cleanup in some schemas, as they were created by users other than the write user configured in Helm.

As a result, I am unable to drop those tables due to lack of ownership permissions. Moving forward, we have two options:

1. Recommended: Reach out to the DBA team and request cleanup of the remaining tables using their superuser privileges, and then rerun the Liquibase changelogs in the same schema.


2. Alternative: Create a new schema and configure Liquibase to target it (by specifying the schema name in liquibase.properties or the changelog files). This will ensure a clean slate for all modules and avoid any permission issues.



Please note: This activity must be fully owned and driven by your team. Iâ€™m happy to support wherever needed, but the responsibility of execution lies with the contractor team. If you need help from Rekha or others, please pull them into a working session and get it closed.

Let me know which option you plan to proceed with so we can align accordingly.

Thanks,
Naveen

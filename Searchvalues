You can explain it clearly and professionally to the user like this:

Hi James,

In our application, there are two ways to create a location:

1. Address Lookup – The user enters an address, and our system queries the LOCUS address source system.

If the address is found and marked as valid in LOCUS, we populate the location details from there.

After that, the user enters the SILI/SES code. Once entered, the system validates whether that code is available and links it to the location.



2. Code Lookup – The user enters the SILI/SES code directly, and the associated location data is populated from the source system for codes.



In this case, it appears the location was created via Address Lookup, and the address provided by the creator was a valid residential address in LOCUS. Because LOCUS returned it as valid, our system populated it without knowing it was a personal address rather than a data center.

That’s why the location is showing an individual house address.

If you want, I can also draft a shorter, direct reply for quick chat use so it’s less formal but still clear. Would you like me to prepare that too?

Hereâ€™s how you can phrase that point very clearly and professionally for the Sunbird mail:

3. Maintaining the Power Chain & Breaker Clarification

In order to correctly represent the hierarchy and ensure that values flow properly across the chain, we need to build asset load devices for:

Connecting UPS â†’ UPS Bank

Connecting UPS Bank â†’ PDU

Connecting PDU â†’ RPP through the associated panel breakers


Additionally, the power spectrum needs to be defined:

At the PDU level: from which UPS bank/panel the PDU is being fed

At the RPP level: to which PDU the RPP is connected


We are planning to write scripts to automatically generate these assets and their values, ensuring consistency across sites.


Clarification Needed:
The provided dataset includes panel details, but breaker details are not listed. Since each PDU panel would typically have a large number of breakers associated with it:

Should we source the breaker details directly from the IFP system (via script), or

Will the Sunbird team / business users be providing the breaker details for these PDU panels?

ðŸ‘‰ This way, you are explaining your approach (building load devices, defining hierarchy, writing scripts), but also making it clear that the open question is only about breaker data â€” where it should come from.

Do you want me to merge this updated point into the full four-point draft (with the other three items we already finalized), so you can send it as one consolidated mail?

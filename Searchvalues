In the current logic, when the position in row (derived from the decimal part of BDFB number) is .00, it gets stored as 0, which is invalid in DC-TRACK.
âœ… Instead, it should start from 1 â€” so .00 should be considered position 1, not 0.

âœ… Prompt to Copilot Agent:

> I previously asked you to generate a query to extract row_label and position_in_row from BDFB numbers during the migration from CPNG to DC-TRACK. The logic was:

row_label is taken from the integer part before the decimal

position_in_row is taken from the number after the decimal


âœ… But there's an issue now:
If the value after the decimal is 00 (e.g., BDFB 116.00, BDFB 142.00), the position is evaluated as 0, which is invalid in DC-TRACK.
DC-TRACK requires positions to start from 1, not 0.

ðŸ”„ I want you to update the logic such that:

If the extracted position is 0, it should be stored as 1

For all other cases, retain the original extracted value


ðŸ§ª Examples:

BDFB 116.00 â†’ row_label = 116, position_in_row = 1 âœ… (not 0)

BDFB 142.00 â†’ row_label = 142, position_in_row = 1

BDFB 105.15 â†’ row_label = 105, position_in_row = 15


Please modify the MySQL (or SQL Server/Oracle if you're targeting that) query to apply this fix to the position_in_row logic.

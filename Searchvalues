‚úÖ Prompt to Generate Downloadable Setup Document

> I need a presentable and downloadable document (like a .docx or .md file) to share with my senior manager that outlines the complete setup steps for our application codebase.

The document should include:

üìÅ Repositories & Modules

Organize the modules under 3 categories:

DRAFTX Modules (GitLab URL: https://gitlab.verizon.com/I85V_1PSC/draftx)

Frontend: draftx-ui-gateway (shared frontend for DRAFTX and CYRUS)

Backend:

draftx-inv-space-service

psc-common-service

psc-location-service

psc-pbl-service

psc-nar-service



CYRUS Modules (GitLab URL: https://gitlab.verizon.com/I85V_1PSC/cyrus)

Backend:

cyrus-inv-pc-service

cyrus-psc-engg-service

cyrus-real-time-power-svc



UNO Modules (GitLab URL: https://gitlab.verizon.com/I85V_1PSC/uno-psc)

Frontend: psrworkflowui

Backend: pscservices



‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

List the following tools that need to be downloaded from the internal portal (AYS):

Apache Maven 3.9.3

Git 2.43.0

Node.js (LTS) 20.9.0

Corretto JDKs: 11, 17, or 21

Visual Studio Code

Spring Tool Suite (STS)

IntelliJ IDEA

Postman


üõ†Ô∏è Steps

Break down the setup instructions into the following:

1. Cloning Repositories using Git


2. Importing into IDEs

For frontend (VS Code)

For backend (STS or IntelliJ)



3. Build and Run

Frontend with npm install and npm start

Backend with Maven commands: mvn clean install, mvn spring-boot:run



4. Settings File Placement

Mention that I will be providing a settings.xml file that needs to be placed inside .m2 folder

Windows path: C:\Users\<username>\.m2\settings.xml

Linux/macOS path: ~/.m2/settings.xml



5. Helm Repositories (Configuration, optional)

https://gitlab.verizon.com/i85v_dftx/draftx-sdlc

https://gitlab.verizon.com/i85v_dftx/cyrus-sdlc

https://gitlab.verizon.com/i85v_dftx/uno-psc-sdlc




üéØ Output format

Please give me this content in a clean, presentable document format (preferably .docx or .md) with proper headings, bullet points, and code blocks where needed.

‚úÖ Tip:

Once Copilot or ChatGPT generates the content:

Ask: "Can you export this as a downloadable .docx file?"

If not supported, copy-paste the output into Microsoft Word or Google Docs, and download it from there.

Would you like me to generate this document for you right now and give you a .docx file download link directly?

Below is a clean, professional explanation + tabular view for the Rectifier tab, including:

Order (L-R)

U-Position

What “Custom Field – PDSC No” means

What “Custom Field – Frame No” means

Whether data is required or optional

What vendors should fill in

✅ RECTIFIER TAB – CLARIFICATIONS

1. ORDER (L → R)

Meaning:
Order (Left-to-Right) represents the physical sequence in which the Rectifiers appear in the battery/rectifier lineup, when viewed from the front.

What to fill:

Assign 1, 2, 3, … in the order the rectifiers are arranged.

If the physical order is unknown during survey, they may leave it blank.


This is identical to the BDFB Panel, BDCBB Panel, PDU Panel, and DC Panel explanation.


---

2. U-POSITION

Meaning:
Indicates whether the rectifier is mounted above or below in the physical vertical stack (the U-height position in the rack or cabinet).

What to fill:

Values typically: Above / Below

If they know the exact U-height (e.g., U12, U13), they may fill it.

If unsure, they may provide Approximate or leave blank.


Again, same logic as the BDFB Panel and BDCBB Panel U-Position.

✅ 3. CUSTOM FIELD – PDSC NUMBER

From your screenshot, the field is:

PDSC No

Meaning:

This is a site-specific custom field used by Verizon for internal asset identification.

“PDSC” most likely expands to:

Power Distribution System Code

or

Power DC System Code

Used internally to identify Rectifier/Power System references in legacy systems.

How to explain to vendors:

This is not a mandatory field for DC-Track.

If they know the PDSC number from internal site documentation, they may fill it.

If they do not know it, they can leave it blank.


Example:

In your screenshot:
PDSC No = 000001
This shows that it is simply an internal identifier.


---

✅ 4. CUSTOM FIELD – FRAME NUMBER

Meaning:

This is also a custom internal tracking field used by Verizon.

The Frame Number generally refers to:

The specific rectifier frame / cabinet frame within the DC power plant

Each rectifier frame holds multiple rectifier modules

The Frame Number helps technicians identify which frame a given module belongs to in large DC power plants


Industry Background (your added explanation):

In DC plants:

A Power Plant contains multiple frames / shelves

Each frame has multiple rectifier modules

Frame numbers help technicians identify the physical location of the rectifier assembly (Frame 1, Frame 2, etc.)


What to tell vendors:

This is not mandatory.

If they can identify the frame from DC power system stickers/labels, they may provide it.

If they do not know it, they can leave it blank.

📘 Rectifier Tab – Summary Table

Field	Meaning	What Should Vendors Fill?	Is it Mandatory?

Order (L → R)	Physical left-to-right arrangement of rectifiers	1, 2, 3… if known	Optional
U-Position	Vertical position (Above / Below / U-height)	Fill if identifiable during survey	Optional
PDSC Number (Custom Field)	Internal Verizon power system identifier	Fill only if known	Optional
Frame Number (Custom Field)	Identifies rectifier frame/shelf in DC power plant	Fill only if known	Optional

📌 Short Description for Email (You can paste this directly)

> Order (L→R) indicates the physical sequence of rectifiers from left to right.
U-Position represents the mounting height (Above/Below or specific U-height).

PDSC Number and Frame Number are Verizon-specific custom fields used for internal referencing of power system frames and rectifier groups. These fields are not mandatory for DC-Track import. If the values are available from site documentation, they may be filled; otherwise, they can be left blank.

If you want, I can now prepare the same structured descriptions + tables for all remaining assets (Panel Bay, DC Panel, HVAC, etc.) so you can attach the full clarification pack in one consolidated document.

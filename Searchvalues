Thank you for the detailed context. Based on your two requirements — integrating the Panel Name and calculating Position Numbers from starting values and number of positions — here's a clear and well-structured prompt you can give to Copilot to generate the correct logic in SQL or Python:


---

✅ Prompt to Ask Copilot:

> I have a response generated for RPP breakers based on the DCTrack breaker template.

1. Panel Name Logic:

I want to add a new column called Panel Name in the response.

This Panel Name needs to be derived from a manually maintained mapping between RPPs and Power Panels (this mapping is present in a file or a lookup table called Power Panel SPL).

Panel Name is not directly present in the CPNG or CPMG system.

So, for each RPP Breaker, find the corresponding Panel Name from Power Panel SPL using either RPP ID or Location as the key (whichever is available in both datasets).


✅ Please show how to:

Add the Panel Name to the output using a join with the Power Panel SPL mapping.

Ensure no null panel names are included in the final response.

> 2. Position Expansion Logic:

I have two fields: Starting Position Number and Number of Positions.

For each row, I want to calculate the actual occupied positions based on these values.


Examples:

If Starting Position Number = 1 and Number of Positions = 3, then it should result in Positions = [1, 2, 3].

If Starting Position = 3 and Number of Positions = 1, then Position = [3].

If needed, show this either as:

A string column like '1,2,3'

Or expand into multiple rows (one per position).



✅ I need Copilot to give me:

A SQL or Python logic to generate this calculated field.

Handle edge cases like when Number of Positions = 0 or null.

Optionally, a flag column like Position Count OK = TRUE if the derived position values match expected logic.

Let me know if you'd prefer this in Python (pandas) or SQL (Postgres/MySQL), and I’ll adapt it.

Got it 👍
You don’t need analysis now — you need a clean, professional reply mail that:

Acknowledges their request

States that you’ve reviewed and provided analysis

Clarifies what should go to Sunbird

Mentions attachments clearly (Laser sheet + Busway free Excel)

Points them to the Google Doc answers (auto-select responses)


Below is a ready-to-send reply. You can copy-paste this as is.

Subject: RE: TPI Data Review – Plymouth & Wilmington Sites

Hi Jessica,

Thanks for sharing this.

I’ve reviewed the vendor-provided data along with the questions raised, and I’ve documented our responses and clarifications in the attached Google Doc (auto-select answers provided for their questions).

Summary of our review and next steps:

For items where no devices are present, those can be reviewed and validated directly with Sunbird.

I’ve attached the Laser site survey sheet as a reference for:

Load devices

Transformers

Utility feed relationships and source references


For Busway-related questions, I’m attaching a separate reference Excel sheet that outlines the expected structure and fields for Busway, which should help clarify what needs to be provided.

The screenshots included in the Google Doc reflect our analysis and directly address the questions raised by the vendor.


Please let me know if you’d like us to walk through any of these items live or if there are specific areas where further clarification is needed.

Thanks,
Naveen

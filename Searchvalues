Perfect, Naveen.
Now I clearly understand exactly what you need:

👉 The PPT should remain HIGH-LEVEL and SIMPLE (10-point structure).
👉 But the VIDEO (your voice + screen recording) should show the REAL STEPS — Gemini inputs, Copilot inputs, schema diagrams, mapping, SQL generation — so that your seniors understand how you actually achieved it.

So I will now give you TWO things:


---

✅ (A) FINAL HIGH-LEVEL PPT STRUCTURE (10 Points) — EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL SHOW IN SLIDES

This PPT will be clean, simple, and senior-level.
Each slide has only 3–5 lines, with no technical jargon — only the outcome.

Slide 1 – Title

“AI-Assisted Wireless Migration: IFP • CPNG • FUSE → DC-Track”


---

Slide 2 – Problem Summary

Three legacy systems

Completely different schemas

Missing structured export files

Needed unified DC-Track-ready data



---

Slide 3 – Step 1: DC-Track Holistic Template Creation

Built DC-Track templates for each asset (UPS, PDU, RPP, etc.)

Identified required fields, formats, connector logic

Defined the target structure for all systems



---

Slide 4 – Step 2: Understanding Legacy Schemas

Only schema diagrams were available

Systems stored assets differently

Used AI to rapidly analyze schema images

Identified tables/columns relevant for each asset



---

Slide 5 – Step 3: AI Mapping from Legacy → DC-Track

Provided holistic template + schema to Gemini

Gemini mapped DC-Track fields to IFP/CPNG/FUSE tables

Produced a unified mapping sheet per asset



---

Slide 6 – Step 4: SQL Query Generation using Copilot

Passed mapping into Copilot

Copilot generated SQL joins for each system

Created consistent queries across 3 DBs

Saved significant development time



---

Slide 7 – Step 5: Data Extraction & CSV Generation

Ran Copilot-generated queries

Extracted UPS/PDU/RPP/GEN/FUEL assets

Aligned output with holistic template



---

Slide 8 – Step 6: Import & Fallout Analysis

Imported CSV to DC-Track

AI helped analyze fallout reasons

Guided missing fields/format corrections

Regenerated corrected CSVs



---

Slide 9 – Step 7: Re-import & Final Success

Re-imported corrected datasets

Achieved near 100% success

AI significantly reduced manual effort



---

Slide 10 – Benefits

Faster SQL + mapping creation

Consistent across 3 legacy databases

Accurate DC-Track alignment

Reusable framework for future migrations



---

👉 This PPT stays senior-friendly and outcome-focused.
👉 Your explanation fills the technical depth, but slides stay clean.


---

✅ (B) WHAT YOU WILL SHOW IN THE VIDEO (SCREEN RECORDING)

This is where you show actual proof of AI work — Gemini + Copilot.
This is EXACTLY what a senior manager expects: high-level PPT + real backend work shown in the demo.

Below is the EXACT VIDEO FLOW you will record, step-by-step, matching the PPT.


---

🎬 VIDEO DEMO STEPS (Your Explanation + What to Show)


---

VIDEO STEP 1 – Show Holistic Template (DC-Track)

🎥 Show the Excel/Sheet of holistic template (green columns).

🗣️ Say this:

> “We first created the DC-Track holistic template for each asset.
This told us the exact fields DC-Track needs, such as voltage, connector type, amperage, model, location, etc.
This became our target structure.”




---

VIDEO STEP 2 – Show Schema Diagrams (IFP / CPNG / FUSE)

🎥 Show schema diagrams one by one (IFP ER diagram → CPNG → FUSE).

🗣️ Say this:

> “The challenge was that we didn’t receive structured data extracts.
We only had schema diagrams, each system storing the assets differently.
So we used AI to interpret these schema images.”




---

VIDEO STEP 3 – Gemini Schema Understanding

🎥 Open Gemini → paste one schema screenshot + holistic template snippet.

🗣️ Say this:

> “We gave Gemini the schema diagrams and the holistic template.
Gemini told us exactly which table and which column in each system matches every DC-Track field.”



🎥 Show Gemini’s sample mapping output (the tabular one you created).


---

VIDEO STEP 4 – Gemini → Mapping Sheet

🎥 Switch to the mapping Excel (green/white mapping table).

🗣️ Say this:

> “This mapping sheet was generated using Gemini.
It shows DC-Track field → IFP table.column → CPNG table.column → FUSE table.column.”




---

VIDEO STEP 5 – Copilot Mapping to SQL

🎥 Open VS Code. Paste mapping as comments.
🎥 Type Copilot prompt:

-- Using the above mapping, generate the SQL query to extract UPS data in DC-Track format.

🎥 Let Copilot auto-generate the SELECT query.

🗣️ Say this:

> “We then passed the mapping to Copilot.
Copilot generated complete SQL queries with joins and aliases matching the DC-Track template.
This saved significant manual time, especially since all 3 systems use different databases.”




---

VIDEO STEP 6 – Query Execution & CSV Output

🎥 Show the CSV output with headings aligned to holistic template.

🗣️ Say this:

> “Running these queries gave us clean CSVs matching DC-Track’s structure.”




---

VIDEO STEP 7 – DC-Track Import & Fallout

🎥 Show fallout screenshot.

🗣️ Say this:

> “We imported into DC-Track and handled fallout by feeding the fallout errors back into Gemini.
Gemini helped identify what was missing or incorrect.”




---

VIDEO STEP 8 – Success Screen

🎥 Show DC-Track success message.

🗣️ Say this:

> “Finally, we re-imported the corrected data and achieved near 100% success.”




---

🔥 THE MAGIC:

👉 Slides show high-level executive summary.
👉 Video shows hands-on AI flow (Gemini → Copilot → SQL → CSV → DC-Track).

This is EXACTLY what senior managers love: ✔ Simple PPT
✔ Strong demo
✔ Clear explanation
✔ Real evidence of AI usage


---

🟦 If you want, I can now generate:

✔ A PPT with the 10 slides

✔ Speaker notes for each slide

✔ A video script with exact words to say (1 continuous speech)

✔ A sample UPS demo mapping + SQL + CSV (ready to show)

Just tell me:

👉 “Generate the PPT + sample demo files.”

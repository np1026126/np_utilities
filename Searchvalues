Based on your screenshot and description, here is a clear and professional bullet-pointed list of items we need from users to proceed with migration, particularly for Windsor:

âœ… Inputs Required from Users for Migration (Windsor):

ðŸ”¹ Correct RPP Names

Ensure RPP names in the Holistic template exactly match the new one-line diagram.

Mismatched names (e.g., RPP_A413, RPP_B212, RPP_A311) are causing relationship issues between IFP and CP&G systems.


ðŸ”¹ Correct Mapping of Floor PDU Connections

Users must validate and provide the correct association of each RPP to its parent Floor PDU via a mandatory field, as per the revised logic.

This structure should reflect the updated one-line diagram logic (RPPs as independent remote panels).


ðŸ”¹ UPS kW/kVA Ratings

UPS data is missing in CPNG.

Users need to manually provide UPS power values (kW/kVA ratings) for all sites where applicable.


ðŸ”¹ HVAC Data

Provide HVAC values (e.g., cooling capacity, system type, etc.) directlyâ€”not via the holistic templateâ€”to ensure completeness and accuracy.


ðŸ”¹ Updated One-Line Diagram (for Windsor)

Users must validate and confirm the latest one-line diagram to support script generation and template restructuring.

This ensures that Floor PDU Panel and PDU Breaker structures are generated accurately.

ðŸ”‹ Battery Asset â€“ Data Validation Issues

During the DC-Track asset load for the Windsor site, the following issues were identified for Battery entries which are currently blocking successful import and association:

1. Missing or Invalid 'Belongs To' Reference

The Belongs To (UPS or Plant) field is critical to determine the parent system the battery is connected to.

However, in the current dataset, this field is populated with "None", which is invalid.

This makes it impossible to link the battery to its corresponding UPS or Power Plant, and prevents DC-Track from establishing the correct power relationship.

Action Required: Please ensure the field is populated with either the UPS name or the Plant name that the battery physically belongs to.



2. Missing 'String Number' and 'Index String'

For DC-Track to correctly model and display the battery bank structure, both the String Number (indicating the string within the bank) and the Index String (used for UI placement and asset hierarchy) are mandatory.

These fields are currently missing or incomplete in the provided template.



3. Incomplete Make and Model Fields

Each battery entry must include:

Capacity 1 Rate (Hours) and Capacity 1 (Ah)

Capacity 2 Rate (Hours) and Capacity 2 (Ah)


These values help determine battery sizing and run-time characteristics, which are necessary for validation and power chain calculations.

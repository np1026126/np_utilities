Got it. If you want Google Gemini to take your uploaded follow-up sheet and automatically generate a cleaned-up version with legends, clear issue categories, and a well-formatted summary for each location, you can give Gemini a structured prompt like this:

Prompt for Google Gemini

You are given a follow-up sheet containing migration issues for RPP, RPP Panels, and associated locations.  
I want you to analyze the sheet and produce a **consolidated summary** with the following requirements:

1. **Categorize Issues into Clear Legends**:
   - RPP Name Missing  
   - RPP Panel Name Missing  
   - Location Name Incorrect / Not Found  
   - Name Mismatch Between IFP DB and User Template  
   - Any Other Data Issues  

2. **For Each Location**:
   - City / Location Name  
   - RPP Name (from IFP DB)  
   - RPP Panel Name (from IFP DB)  
   - RPP Name (from User Template)  
   - RPP Panel Name (from User Template)  
   - Exact Issue Category (from the above legends)  
   - Suggested Action for Users  

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - Create a **new cleaned-up sheet** with one row per location and issue type.  
   - Include a **Legends Section at the top** explaining each issue category clearly.  
   - Ensure the sheet is easy to read with clear column headers.  

4. **Corrections**:
   - If possible, automatically fix simple mismatches like hyphen vs underscore.  
   - Highlight rows needing manual user input in a separate "Pending Action" column.  

5. **Final Output**:
   - A single summarized sheet with:  
       - Legends at the top  
       - Categorized issues  
       - Suggested actions  

Please generate this summary in a professional format so it can be shared directly with users.

What This Will Do

Gemini will read your original sheet.

It will categorize all issues into a standard legend.

It will fix simple naming mismatches automatically (like hyphen vs underscore).

It will generate a clean sheet with clear issue descriptions and actions for users.

If you want, I can also give you a sample legend structure and final column headers so the output from Gemini looks perfectly standardized.

Do you want me to prepare that sample legend and column structure? It will save you time.

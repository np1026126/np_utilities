Thanks for the detailed screenshot and context. Based on what you’re trying to do, here’s the ideal prompt to give Copilot (or any code assistant) in natural language to generate your PostgreSQL query dynamically using the mapping table:


---

✅ Suggested Prompt to Give Copilot:

> I have a mapping Excel (now in CSV) where:

Column A = DC_TRACK_COLUMN_NAME (the desired output field)

Column B = CPNG_TABLE_NAME (source table in legacy CPNG)

Column C = CPNG_COLUMN_NAME (source column in the table)

Column D = DEFAULT_VALUE (fallback value if CPNG column/table is N/A)


Write a PostgreSQL query that builds a SELECT clause using this logic:

1. For each DC-TRACK column:

If CPNG table and column are specified (not N/A), pull the value using a join from that table and column.

If either table or column is N/A, use the default value as a hardcoded fallback.



2. Alias the final output as the DC-TRACK column name (Column A).


3. Join the necessary tables based on the mapping (assume joins can be made on DP_NUM, DP_MAN, or MODULEID, depending on context).


4. Skip unmapped rows if all four fields are blank or unusable.


5. The final output should be a single query (or a CTE-based query) selecting columns from CPNG and outputting the result in the DC-TRACK structure.

🔧 Example Result Copilot Should Output (based on the screenshot):

Assume this output structure:

SELECT 
  dp.DP_NUM AS "Name",
  dp.DP_MAN AS "Make",
  m.M_NAME AS "Model",
  mi.SWITCHNAME AS "Location",
  'Planned' AS "Status",
  1.75 AS "Discharge VPC",
  '3Hrs' AS "Target Run Time(Hours)",
  80 AS "Battery Recharge Factor (%)",
  pdd.PDD_DC_TOTAL_AMPS AS "Custom Field Load (amps)",
  0 AS "Custom Field Anticipated (A)",
  pdd.PDD_FLOAT_VOLTS AS "Custom Field Float Voltage",
  dp.QTY_RECT_BAYS AS "Custom Field Bay",
  dp.CREATED_DATE AS "Installation Date",
  pdd.PDD_TIMESTAMP AS "Custom Field Load Last updated",
  '1/1/1900' AS "Custom Field Anticipated Last Updated",
  dp.SHUNT_SIZE AS "Custom Field Engineered Capacity",
  pdd.PDD_DC_TOTAL_AMPS AS "Custom Field Polled Amps",
  pdd.PDD_TIMESTAMP AS "Custom Field Plant Last Polled",
  99999 AS "Custom Field Plant Financial Project ID",
  99999 AS "Custom Field Owner of this Record",
  99999 AS "Custom Field Controller",
  99999 AS "Custom Field Equipment Served",
  dp.DP_IP AS "Custom Field IP-Address"
FROM 
  "TBL_DC_PLANT" dp
LEFT JOIN "TBL_MANU" m ON dp.DP_MAN = m.M_NUM
LEFT JOIN "TBL_MSC_INFO" mi ON dp.DP_NUM = mi.MODULEID
LEFT JOIN "TBL_PUE_DC_DAILY" pdd ON pdd.PDD_PDP_NUMBER = dp.DP_NUM

✅ Tips for Copilot to make this easier:

Let Copilot know if your CSV is preloaded into a Python script or if you want this dynamic query generation done in Python.

If you're using Python, you can also ask:

> “Based on the CSV that contains the mapping of DC_TRACK to CPNG columns, generate a dynamic SELECT query string in Python using pandas, skipping NA and using default values when needed.”




Would you like me to give you a working Python code snippet that reads this mapping CSV and generates the query automatically as a string?

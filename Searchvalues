Description:

Business Partnership and Cost Optimization:

Actively collaborated with business partners, especially Meghna, to address production AYS (Are You Stuck) buzzes raised by users in the OnePace Yelp channel.

Engaged directly with users to understand their issues in real time, explained the intended application flow, and provided immediate workarounds wherever applicable to prevent unnecessary ticket creation — reducing both effort and resolution time.

In several scenarios, clarified misunderstandings about system behavior, enabling users to proceed without waiting for backend fixes or manual interventions.

Provided interim fixes and temporary solutions for code-related issues to ensure business continuity until the permanent solutions were in place.


Automation & Innovation:

Initiated the use of GitHub Copilot and Google Gemini to automate and optimize day-to-day development tasks, including:

Validating code changes before merging.

Enhancing accuracy in logic implementation during migration activities.

Automating part of the matching logic and transformation in data migration scripts.


These efforts contribute to reduction in manual effort, fewer defects, and improved delivery speed, ultimately translating into cost savings and enhanced efficiency in core operations.

Here’s a clean and precise prompt you can give to Copilot or Google Gemini so they know exactly what transformation you want on your Excel sheet:


---

Prompt:
"I have an Excel sheet with a column named 'Panel' and another column named 'Starting Position No'.
Every 'Panel' value is either 'Panel 1' or 'Panel 2'.
I need to update 'Starting Position No' for all rows where 'Panel' = 'Panel 2' by adding 42 to the existing value in 'Starting Position No'.
If 'Panel' = 'Panel 1', leave the value unchanged.
Please write a Python (pandas) or Excel formula/VBA script to do this."


---

If you want Copilot to directly do it in Excel formula without Python, you can give this shorter prompt:


---

Prompt:
"In Excel, in a new column, I want to display the 'Starting Position No' where if 'Panel' = 'Panel 2', it should be the existing 'Starting Position No' + 42, otherwise keep it the same. Give me the Excel formula for this."


---

If you want, I can directly give you both the Python (pandas) code and the Excel formula so you can run it immediately. That way you don’t even need to wait for Copilot to generate it. Would you like me to prepare both?

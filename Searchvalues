Here is a clear, formal, polished mail draft exactly matching what you want to tell Jessica:

✔ You are informing her that you are adding the Make/Model-specific columns to Battery because it is better to capture vendor-specific values
✔ You are providing the actual DC-Track imported sheet instead of the generic holistic template
✔ You are telling her that she can use this sheet as the base, modify it, and give it to the vendor
✔ You are not yet adding the detailed per-asset clarifications — that will follow later (as you requested)

This is the mail introduction section only, which you will place before the detailed asset-wise clarifications.

📧 Mail Draft – Intro Section (Formal & Professional)

Hi Jessica,

As discussed, I have prepared the updated set of templates and reference sheets for the upcoming Wall TWP and Branchburg site surveys. Before providing the detailed clarification for each asset, I wanted to share the following updates:

1. Battery Template Enhancements
For the Battery tab, I have added a few additional columns at the end of the sheet.
These fields are needed whenever a new vendor-specific Make and Model is introduced.
Capturing these values up front will help ensure that the DC-Track Make/Model library remains accurate and consistent for future imports.
(For generic models, these can remain blank; for new models, please fill them in.)

2. Updated Reference Template (DC-Track Imported Data)
Instead of sharing the earlier sample holistic template, I have extracted the actual DC-Track imported sheet for these assets.
This sheet reflects the final, system-validated format that was successfully imported into DC-Track.

You can use this file as a baseline template and provide it to the survey team so that they can directly update or adjust their entries on top of it.

This will help ensure:

Correct column structure

Correct naming conventions

Accurate example values

Fewer corrections during validation and import


I will follow this section with the full set of clarifications for all AC and DC assets based on the questions raised and the gaps we identified yesterday.

Thanks,
Naveen

Hi Team,

There’s a request from the users to:

1. Regenerate HVAC assets for all TAP sites.


2. For 4 specific TAP site locations, regenerate 7 assets — UPS, 4PG, panel, panel breakers, and their connections with HVAC (including how 4PG and panel breakers are linked to HVAC).


3. For the remaining TAP sites (other than the 4 above), only HVAC regeneration is needed.



Please confirm if we can proceed and the timelines for completing this.

Got it, Greg — I’ll go through the video you’ve shared and review the process in detail. I’ll also check against the project we’ve already generated for Wings of Fight (PC reference application) to see where the slowness and issues might be coming from. I’ll share my observations once I’ve completed the review.

Do you want me to also make a slightly shorter, more conversational version for Slack so it blends better in the thread?

Do you want me to also make a slightly shorter, action-focused version so the team can respond faster in Slack?

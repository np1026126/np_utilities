Here is the exact prompt you can use in Copilot to generate the load sheet for all PDUs from your "floor PDU with missing PDUs" sheet:

✅ Copilot Prompt to Generate Load Sheet:

> From the sheet "floor_pdu_with_missing.csv", extract only rows where the "Name" column starts with "PDU".

For each such PDU:

1. Create a new row in a separate sheet (named "Load Panel Sheet").


2. Set the following fields for each row:



- Operation: ADD  
- Object: POWER PANEL-LOCAL  
- Floor PDU Name: same as PDU Name (from "Name" column)  
- Load Name: convert PDU name to Load name — for example:  
    - PDU-A11 → LOAD-A1  
    - PDU-A21 → LOAD-A2  
    - PDU-D31 → LOAD-D3  
    - (Drop the last digit and keep just the first part after PDU-)  
- Location: use the value from "Location" column (same row as the PDU)  
- Phase Volts: 3-phase  
- Wire Color: 120 Black/Red/Blue  
- Rating: 1200  
- No. of Poles: 12  
- Panel Layout: Two Column  
- Pole Line: Odd/Even  
- First Pole #: 1  
- Status: Planned

3. Keep the final output in Excel format with columns in the exact order shown above.


4. Repeat for each unique PDU across all sites.

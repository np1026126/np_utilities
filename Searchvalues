Hereâ€™s a polished version of what you can post or mail to users to ask smoothly for their inputs while also confirming the IT follow-up timeline:

Subject: Request for Timeline on User Follow-ups & IT Follow-up Status

Body:

Hi All,

As part of the migration activities, we have categorized the follow-ups into two sections: IT follow-ups and user-side follow-ups.

The IT follow-ups are already in progress, and we are targeting to complete them by Wednesday.

For the user follow-ups, we have already shared the list of pending inputs required from your side.


It would be great if you could let us know the tentative timeline for providing these inputs so that we can plan to take them up in parallel with the IT follow-ups. This will help us ensure everything is ready for the final migration together.

Please confirm the expected timelines for the user follow-ups so we can align accordingly.

Thanks for your support and coordination!

Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also give you a Slack-friendly short version so you can post it quickly in the user group instead of sending a formal mail.

Do you want me to prepare that?

Subject: Request to Review and Monitor Progress on Site View Migration Feature

Hi [Manager's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

I wanted to bring to your attention the current status of the Site View Migration feature. The progress so far hasn’t been on par with expectations, and there seems to be some ambiguity regarding ownership — whether it should be handled by the developer or the tester.

Could you please look into this and help clarify the responsibilities within the team? It would also be great if we could ensure consistent progress going forward. I would appreciate it if you could keep a close eye on the development of this feature and help the team stay aligned.

Additionally, I’d like the team to provide regular and proper updates via email so we can track the momentum and address any blockers early on.

Thanks for your support on this. Let me know if you'd like to connect further on this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

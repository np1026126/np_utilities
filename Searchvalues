Here is the exact and structured prompt you can give to Copilot to compare your two folders of CSVs ‚Äî one with all columns and one with only mandatory and relationship-related columns ‚Äî and find if any important columns (especially for relationships like plant, plant bay, etc.) are missing in the mandatory set:

‚úÖ Copilot Prompt to Compare Mandatory and Full Asset CSVs:

> I am providing two folders:

1. Full_Assets_CSVs ‚Äî This folder contains CSV files for each DC-TRAC asset. These files have all the columns from DC-TRAC templates.


2. Mandatory_Assets_CSVs ‚Äî This folder contains the same asset CSVs, but includes only:

Mandatory fields (identified with a single * or double ** star in the column name).

Additional fields which are required to establish relationships (e.g., plant, plant bay, source, location, etc.).




üîç I want you to do the following:

For each asset (matching by file name in both folders):

Compare the column names in the full CSV and the mandatory CSV.

Check if any mandatory field (with * or **) is missing in the mandatory CSV.

Check if any field required for relationship formation (such as plant, plant bay, PDU name, source breaker, connected to, location, etc.) is missing in the mandatory CSV.

Generate a report for each asset listing:

‚úÖ Fields present and valid in the mandatory CSV.

‚ùå Fields that are missing but required.

üß© Suggestions for additional fields that may be needed for relationship creation based on the asset type.




üí° Output format:

One summary report per asset.

Or a single consolidated CSV/table with:

Asset Name

Missing Mandatory Fields

Missing Relationship Fields

Comments/Suggestions (if any)



This is to validate that no critical field for data load or power chain formation is missed from the mandatory CSV files.

Let me know if you want me to draft an example report/table format that Copilot should generate from this analysis.

Here is your professionally rewritten update message:

Hi Team,

I have completed regenerating the HT sheet for all 54 SAP sites. Currently, I have organized the data into 7 separate sheets, each containing entries for all 54 locations based on asset type.

These 7 sheets will now be shared with Jason, who will proceed to segregate them into 54 individual sheets, one for each SAP location. Each of those location-specific sheets will contain all 7 asset tabs relevant to that site.

Will keep you posted once the segregation is completed.

Thanks,
Naveen

Let me know if you'd like a shorter version or if it should be drafted for a Slack message.

1. Paste all values from HVAC into Column A of a new sheet.


2. Paste all values from Final PDU into Column B.


3. In Column C, use this formula:



=IF(COUNTIF(B:B, A2)=0, "Missing", "Present")

4. Filter for "Missing" in Column C to get the 8 missing locations.



Would you like me to also generate the actual Python script or Excel Power Query code for this task?

- Custom Field HVAC Sub Type Status: Active
  - Custom Field Percent for Zone: 100

Please generate the final table with 938 rows by combining the above logic. The "Location" column should match exactly what is in the location file (e.g., `ALPRGAGQ > Battery room 2B`). HVAC name should increment within each site group.

Once you upload both files to Copilot with this prompt, it will generate a final combined HVAC holistic sheet with accurate values and structure.

Let me know if youâ€™d like this as an Excel formula-based transformation or Python code too.

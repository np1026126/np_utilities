We are planning a production hotfix deployment which includes only four defect fixes. As this is a minor and targeted release, there is no performance testing required for this deployment.

As per the communication received from the N21 team, who typically handles performance test execution, they have also confirmed that this release does not warrant running the performance test suite.

Additionally, our end-to-end team will continue to run performance tests as part of the regular cadence, ensuring overall system integrity.

Kindly confirm your approval for proceeding without performance testing for this hotfix. Once approved, we will proceed with a conditional go for the production release.

Please let us know if you need any further information.

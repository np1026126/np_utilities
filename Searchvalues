Here’s a clear, professional Slack message you can send:

Hi Team,

There’s a request from the users to:

1. Regenerate HVAC assets for all TAP sites.


2. For 4 specific TAP site locations, regenerate 7 assets — UPS, 4PG, panel, panel breakers, and their connections with HVAC (including how 4PG and panel breakers are linked to HVAC).


3. For the remaining TAP sites (other than the 4 above), only HVAC regeneration is needed.



Please confirm if we can proceed and the timelines for completing this.

Do you want me to also make a slightly shorter, action-focused version so the team can respond faster in Slack?

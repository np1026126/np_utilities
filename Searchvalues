Here’s a professional and polite Slack message you can send to Howard and the Sunbird team (Andy, Samer, etc.) to ask for an ETA — while keeping it firm and respectful since they’re a vendor providing support:

Slack Message Draft:

> Hi @Howard @Andy,

Thanks for the updates shared earlier. Since this issue is currently a blocker for our demo and validation activities, could you please confirm the ETA for the fix?

We understand the engineering team is analyzing it, but we’d like to plan our internal activities accordingly. Please let us know if we can expect the resolution by today or if it might extend further.

Appreciate your continued support and quick turnaround on this.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a shorter version (for a quick thread reply) or keep this full version to post as a main message in the shared channel?

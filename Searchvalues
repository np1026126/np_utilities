Hereâ€™s a clear and complete prompt you can give to GitHub Copilot or Gemini to generate the UPS entries from your Floor PDU CSV file based on your detailed instructions and the screenshots you provided:

âœ… Prompt to Ask Copilot or Gemini:

> I have a CSV file named floor_pdu.csv which contains a column with names starting with PDU and another column for Old RPP Name.

I want to create a new UPS sheet (CSV format) for all the PDU rows only (i.e., rows where:

the value in the Floor PDU column starts with "PDU"

the Old RPP Name column is empty


For each such PDU, generate a corresponding UPS entry using the following rules and default values:

ðŸ›  Mapping Logic:

If PDU name is PDU A11 â†’ UPS name = UPS A1

If PDU name is PDU A21 â†’ UPS name = UPS A2

If PDU name is PDU A31 â†’ UPS name = UPS A3

If PDU name is PDU A41 or PDU A42 â†’ UPS name = UPS A4


ðŸ“‹ For each UPS entry, populate the following columns with values:

Column Name	Value / Rule

Operation	ADD
Object	UPS
Make	Generic
Model	Generic
Name	Derived from mapping logic above
Location	Same as the location of the PDU
Status	Planned
Rating (KVA)	Leave blank (to be filled by user)
Rating (KW)	Leave blank (to be filled by user)
Rating (VAC)	480
Output Wiring	4-Wire + Ground
Location Name	Same as Location
Front Faces	North
Custom Field - Nominal AC Output	250
Custom Field - Output LD	250 V
Custom Field - UPS Maintenance	Y
Custom Field - UPS Phase	3 Phase
Custom Field - Power Factor	1
Custom Field - AC Output Voltage	450
Installation Date	01/01/2000


Please generate the output in Excel/CSV format with these columns and values for all the matching PDU rows (where Old RPP is blank) for all 46 sites.

This prompt gives Copilot or Gemini:

The exact condition to filter the rows (PDU + empty RPP).

The UPS name mapping logic.

The exact column structure and values.

Instruction to generate CSV/Excel format output.


You can now paste this into Copilot Chat or Gemini with your sample floor_pdu.csv, and it should generate the required UPS sheet. Let me know if you want me to write a sample Python script or Excel macro as well.

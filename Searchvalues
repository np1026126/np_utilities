Great — let’s lay out the estimated timeline starting from 25th July (when the first batch of 54 site asset files are expected) and map out the key steps, their duration, and dependencies.

🗓️ Estimated Timeline for Asset Migration – 54 Sites Starting 25th July

Step No.	Task	Start Date	End Date	Duration	Dependencies / Notes

1	Receive Asset Templates from Users	25th July	25th July	1 day	Data from users
2	Extract and Upload Make & Model for All Assets	26th July	29th July	3 working days	Critical to avoid asset import errors
3	UAT Upload – Initial Asset Load	30th July	2nd Aug	4 working days	Depends on successful make/model upload
4	Error Capture & Log	2nd Aug	5th Aug	2 working days	UAT logs and rejection reports
5	Fix Issues and Remediate Templates	6th Aug	9th Aug	4	

Perfect — based on your inputs and the 25th July and 15th August data delivery milestones, and considering the environments UAT → PLE → Production, here is a complete timeline with dates, including steps, durations, and checkpoints to ensure the soft launch (target: End of September) can happen smoothly.

✅ Full Migration Timeline with Environment Phases

Phase	Step	Start Date	End Date	Duration	Details / Notes

UAT (Test Stage)	Receive 54 sites asset templates from users	25 July (Thu)	25 July	1 day	Based on user commitment
	Make & Model Upload	26 July (Fri)	30 July (Tue)	3 working days	Needed for all assets to be accepted
	Asset Upload & Flow Test in UAT	31 July (Wed)	6 Aug (Tue)	5 working days	Initial load + flow validation
	Error Log, Fix & Template Remediation	7 Aug (Wed)	13 Aug (Tue)	5 working days	Data fixes based on UAT fallout
	Revalidation in UAT	14 Aug (Wed)	16 Aug (Fri)	3 working days	Ensure flows, relationships are intact


| PLE (Staging for Final Test) | Make & Model Re-upload | 19 Aug (Mon) | 20 Aug (Tue) | 2 working days | Prep for near-prod simulation | |  | Asset Upload in PLE | 21 Aug (Wed) | 26 Aug (Mon) | 4 working days | Same set of 54 sites | |  | Power Chain End-to-End Validation | 27 Aug (Tue) | 30 Aug (Fri) | 4 working days | Full AC & DC flows tested | |  | Remediation if any | 2 Sep (Mon) | 4 Sep (Wed) | 3 working days | Any PLE issues fixed fast |

| Second Batch (88 Sites) | Receive 88 site templates | 15 Aug (Thu) | 15 Aug | 1 day | As per user timeline | |  | Follow same steps (UAT → PLE) | 16 Aug | 13 Sep | 4 weeks approx. | Overlaps with PLE of 1st batch |

| Production Deployment | Final Asset Upload – Production | 16 Sep (Mon) | 20 Sep (Fri) | 5 working days | Combined 144 sites | |  | Final Flow Validation (Smoke Test) | 23 Sep (Mon) | 25 Sep (Wed) | 3 working days | UAT + PLE issues must be closed | |  | Business Sign-off & Soft Launch | 30 Sep (Mon) | 30 Sep | 1 day | Target date for soft launch ✅ |

🚨 Critical Dependency – Power Chain Completion

> AC Flow must include:
UPS → UPS Bank → Load Devices → Floor PDU → RPP → Breaker



> DC Flow must include:
Power Plant → DC Bay → Plant Panel → Power Panel (DC Panel) → Breaker



> 🔺 If any of the above elements are missing in the templates, the power chain cannot be fully modeled in DCTrack, and the application flow will fail for that site.

✅ Soft Launch Impact Assessment

If users do not provide complete power chain data for all 144 sites by 15 Aug, soft launch may face:

Missing flows in the application

Fallback to manual mapping

Delays in production readiness for those sites

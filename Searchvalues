Here’s a polished and professional version of your Slack update that you can post in the user migration channel:

User Migration Update – PNC Inventory Assets
For the recently regenerated 7 sites, we observed that a few of these locations do not contain any RPPs. Instead, they are configured as bus-based setups.

Our current calculation logic is designed based on RPP and RPP panel configurations, so these bus-based locations will not reflect results in line with RPP-based calculations.

Could you please confirm if these sites are expected to remain bus-based only, or if RPPs are planned to be added later? This will help us align our calculation logic accordingly.

Would you like me to make it slightly shorter and more conversational (for Slack tone), or keep this formal tone?

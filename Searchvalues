Got it 👍 You want a clean, professional approval message to send to your manager, clearly stating that this must go to Production (Unity) because the dependent team needs it.
Here are two polished versions—pick the tone you like.
✅ Professional & Clear (recommended for email / Jira / Slack)
Hi [Manager Name],
I’ve reviewed the changes related to NTSWSF-13136 (UUID floor name feature / DC-Track sync updates) and they look good to proceed.
These updates are required in Production (Unity) as the downstream teams depend on this functionality for their ongoing work and site view syncs.
Kindly approve the deployment to Unity at your convenience.
Thanks,
Naveen
✅ Slightly Direct & Time-Sensitive
Hi [Manager Name],
I’ve reviewed and approved the changes for NTSWSF-13136.
This needs to be deployed to Production (Unity) since the dependent teams require these updates for floor/location sync with DC-Track.
Requesting your approval to proceed with the production deployment.
Thanks,
Naveen
✅ Very Short (Slack-friendly)
Hi [Manager Name],
I’ve reviewed and approved NTSWSF-13136. This needs to go to Production (Unity) as dependent teams require these changes. Please approve the prod deployment. Thanks!
If you want, tell me:
Is this for email, Jira comment, or Slack?
Do you want it more assertive (since teams are blocked) or neutral?
I’ll fine-tune it exactly to match your manager’s style.

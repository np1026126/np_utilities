Subject: Escalation Regarding Task Progress on Anticipated Load Calculator & HVAC Integration

Dear [Manager's Name],

I would like to bring to your attention some challenges we are facing with the tasks assigned to [Colleague's Name] so that we can plan the next steps effectively.

Tasks Assigned

1. Anticipated Load Calculator Screens (AC flow â€“ RPP, RPP panel-based) and its equivalent on the UNO screen.


2. Updating New Heat Load Instance from HVAC:

On Submit, the HVAC data for wireless locations needs to be updated to the Cyrus DB and pushed back to DC Track (similar to the existing "Zone Netted" flow).




Challenges Faced

Technical Understanding Gaps:

For the anticipated load calculator, instead of differentiating the AC flow logic (RPP, RPP Panel, Location) from the DC plant logic, the same DC approach was reused, causing repeated failures.

Even after we helped correct the query logic, the same challenges persisted when implementing it on the UNO screen.

She was unsure how to integrate two services from the frontend to backend and required repeated hand-holding on API flow.


Dependency on Others:

Frequently required help to identify the files she modified and could not explain the changes or logic clearly.

Code was generated using Copilot, but she was unable to explain why certain functions (e.g., generic filters) were used.


Impact on Timelines:

Both tasks remained open for longer durations since the technical and application-level understanding was lacking, increasing dependencies on other team members to complete the work.



Current Status

Task #2 (HVAC integration) has already been reassigned due to lack of progress.

Task #1 (Anticipated Load Calculator) was partially completed after significant support but is pending full integration on the UNO screen.


Recommendation

Given the current situation, I recommend:

Reassigning the remaining work to ensure timelines are met.

Providing additional technical mentoring or training to [Colleague's Name] for future tasks so that such delays can be avoided.


Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also prepare a short Slack version for quick escalation instead of a formal mail.

Do you want me to create that version too?

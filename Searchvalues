Thanks for pointing this out, Jonathan.

Yes, we reviewed the query and identified that both NEC Rocklin and MSC Rocklin share the same short name in IFP, which is why the data pulled includes rooms from both sites. Since our query was based on the site short name, it inadvertently included NEC Rocklin rooms as well.

We're currently working only with MSC sites, and NEC should not be considered. Thanks again for bringing this to our attention — we’ll correct the data accordingly.

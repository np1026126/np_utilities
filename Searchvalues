Slack Message Draft:

> Hi @Howard,

I made the XML changes as per the email instructions and added the code parameter by combining the location and room values. After adding the code, I was able to see that the cabinets are getting created in DC-TRAC successfully.

However, since there’s no mapping defined for the status, I removed the status field from the XML. After removing it, the cabinets are still getting created with the status showing as “Planned,” but I’m seeing the origin as “CNDB, Not Valid.”

Could you please check why this might be happening and confirm if this behavior is expected or if any further changes are needed?

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a shorter version (2-3 lines) suitable for a Slack thread reply under the same discussion?

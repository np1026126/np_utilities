Perfect — I fully understand what you need.

✔ You already showed how Gemini generated the mapping sheet.

✔ Now you want to show how Copilot generated the SQL script based on:

(1) DC-Track Plant Holistic Template (CSV)

(2) The Mapping Sheet (DC-Track ↔ CPNG)


✔ In the video, you will say:

> “I provided Copilot with the DC-Track template + the mapping sheet, and Copilot generated the SQL queries automatically.”



✔ For that, you need a high-quality, professional Prompt Engineer–level prompt.

📌 “SQL Generation Prompt for DC-Track → CPNG ETL Automation”

Objective:
Using the DC-Track Plant Holistic Template (CSV) and the DC-Track ↔ CPNG Mapping Sheet that I provided, generate a complete and production-ready SQL query that extracts all the mapped fields from the CPNG schema and formats them exactly in the DC-Track holistic structure.


---

📌 Inputs Provided

1. DC_Track_Plant_Holistic_Template.csv
– Defines the target column names and final output structure.


2. DC_Plant_Mapping_Final.csv
– Contains four columns:

DC-TRACK Column Name | CPNG Table Name | CPNG Column Name | Mapped? (Yes/No)

– Only rows with Mapped? = Yes must be included in the SQL output.


3. Schema understanding
– Use table names, foreign-key relationships, and parent-child links implied by the mapping sheet.




---

📌 Task Description

Generate a single consolidated SQL SELECT statement that:

✔ Pulls data from the correct CPNG tables

(using the table and column names from the mapping sheet)

✔ Applies correct JOINs

(based on the presence of DP_NUM, DP_MSC_NUMBER, and other keys visible in mapped columns)

✔ Converts the CPNG column names into DC-Track template column names

(using aliasing like:
dp.PLANT_NO AS "Name"
mi.SWITCHNAME AS "Location")

✔ Handles unmapped DC-Track fields

If a DC-Track field has Mapped? = No, generate a dummy value:

'N/A', 0, or '1900-01-01' depending on the type.



✔ Handles data cleansing & formatting

Use logic like:

COALESCE() for missing values

DATE_FORMAT() or equivalent for date formatting

Rounding floats

Converting amps/volts accordingly


✔ Uses subqueries if necessary

For fields that require latest readings from tables like TBL_PUE_DC_DAILY, use:

SELECT ... ORDER BY pdd.PDD_TIMESTAMP DESC LIMIT 1


---

📌 Output Format (Strict Requirement)

Copilot must output only the SQL query, formatted like:

SELECT
    dp.PLANT_NO AS "Name",
    m.MANUFACTURER AS "Make",
    dp.MODEL AS "Model",
    mi.SWITCHNAME AS "Location",
    ...
    (SELECT ... ) AS "Custom Field Polled Amps",
    (SELECT ... ) AS "Custom Field Float Voltage",
    ...
FROM cpng.TBL_DC_PLANT dp
LEFT JOIN cpng.TBL_MSC_INFO mi ON mi.MSC = dp.DP_MSC_NUMBER
LEFT JOIN cpng.TBL_MANU m      ON m.M_NUM = dp.DP_MAN
...
ORDER BY dp.DP_NUM;

✔ The SQL must follow the order of columns in the DC-Track holistic template.

✔ Every DC-Track column must appear in the SELECT clause.


---

📌 Rules

1. Never guess table names — use exactly the table names from the mapping sheet.


2. Never rename or modify DC-Track target columns.


3. Only fields with "Mapped? = Yes" should be populated from CPNG.


4. For columns requiring the latest value, use descending timestamp + LIMIT 1.


5. The final SQL must be ready for execution in the CPNG database.

📌 Deliverable

A complete consolidated SQL extraction script that recreates the DC-Track Plant holistic structure directly from CPNG.

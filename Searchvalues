Subject / Slack message:
Need clarification on BDFG Panel breakers data

Message:
Hi [Name],

As part of the migration activity, we have successfully imported both BDFG and BDFGPanel assets from CPNG. However, we are unable to retrieve any BDFGPanel breaker details from the CPNG source.

Could you please check and confirm whether breaker information for BDFGPanels is maintained in CPNG? If yes, kindly let us know the location or reference table/source where this data is available, so that we can include it in the extraction.

Thanks,
Naveen

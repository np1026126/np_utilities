Got it — you want to guide GitHub Copilot properly so that it can write the right code for your addMirrorUpdateToBulkRequest method.

Copilot works best when you give it very clear, context-rich instructions in the form of comments or prompts in your code. Since you already have the method and want to add a new field (totalSpaceLoads in kilowatts from inputDTO) for RPP, RPP panels, PDU, and UPS bank, here’s how you can phrase it so Copilot writes the right code for you:


---

1. Go inside your addMirrorUpdateToBulkRequest method

Add a comment just above where you want the code generated. For example:

// TODO: Get total load values in kilowatts from inputDTO.totalLoad
// Add this as "totalSpaceLoads" field when updating DC Track for RPP, RPP Panels, PDU, and UPS bank
// Use the same bulk request structure as existing fields for consistency

Then hit Enter and start typing something like:

// Copilot: please add code here

and pause. Copilot will generate a suggestion.


---

2. Example of what you can tell Copilot in plain English

In the comment or as a direct prompt, you can say:

> "Inside addMirrorUpdateToBulkRequest, add logic to fetch totalLoad from inputDTO and store it as totalSpaceLoads in kilowatts in the bulk update request for RPP, RPP panels, PDU, and UPS bank. Follow the same pattern as existing fields in the bulk request body."




---

3. Why this works

Copilot scans the whole file and your comment tells it what to do.

By referencing inputDTO.totalLoad, Copilot knows which variable to read from.

Mentioning RPP, RPP panels, PDU, and UPS bank helps it replicate the logic for all entities.



---

4. Extra tip

If the bulk request update code is similar for all components, you can also ask:

// Refactor the logic so the code for RPP, RPP panels, PDU, and UPS bank reuses the same function

Copilot can suggest common helper methods if it detects repetitive code.


---

If you want, I can give you the exact Copilot-ready comment for your method so it automatically generates the correct code for totalSpaceLoads.

Do you want me to write that comment for you?

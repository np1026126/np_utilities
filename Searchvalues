Thanks for the clarity. Here's exactly what you're trying to do and how to ask Copilot or Gemini to help you achieve it ‚Äî along with a clean, accurate prompt to copy and paste.

‚úÖ Goal:

You want to map old RPP names to new standardized RPP names, but:

Exclude rows where the Floor PDU column starts with "PDU".

Only consider rows where the RPP name was changed (not PDU names).

You have:

A new modified sheet (floor_pdu1) with new RPP names and a blank column Old RPP Name.

An original sheet (floor_pdu_original) with the old RPP names and original location info.




---

‚úÖ Output you need:

A column called Old RPP Name in your modified sheet that is:

Filled using matching new RPP name ‚Üî old RPP name and location from the original file.

Blank for rows where the name is a PDU (i.e., Floor PDU starts with "PDU").

üì• Prompt to use in Copilot or Gemini:

I have two Excel files:

1. `floor_pdu_original.csv`: This contains the original RPP names and their locations. (Example: column `RPP Name`, column `Location`)
2. `floor_pdu1.csv`: This contains the modified RPP names with a blank column `Old RPP Name` that I want to populate.

Instructions:
- Compare the RPP names and locations from both files.
- Ignore any rows in `floor_pdu1.csv` where the `Floor PDU` starts with "PDU". These are actual PDUs, not RPPs.
- For the rest, map each `RPP Name` in `floor_pdu1.csv` to the corresponding original `RPP Name` from `floor_pdu_original.csv` **based on location match and similar name pattern**, and write it in the `Old RPP Name` column.
- If no match is found, leave the `Old RPP Name` column blank.
- Output the updated `floor_pdu1.csv`.

Optional: Use fuzzy or closest match logic only when exact match fails, but location match is mandatory.

üõ†Ô∏è Tips for Better Accuracy:

If you're using Python with Pandas or Excel VBA for this, you can automate it more precisely.

If Copilot isn't giving exact row-based matching, try sorting both sheets by Location first.

If using Copilot in Excel, ask for a Power Query or INDEX-MATCH formula that follows the above logic.


Would you like a Python script or Excel formula-based approach to automate this yourself as a fallback?

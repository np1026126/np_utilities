Hi Andres, just to clarify the panel naming approach:

Since it's challenging to determine the exact RPP each breaker will feed (as shown in the second screenshot, e.g., RPP_A5_A1, RPP_A11_A2), I’m using a consistent naming format for now as shown in the first screenshot:
PDU-[name]-PANEL 1, PDU-[name]-PANEL 2, PDU-[name]-SPARE 1, etc.

This way, the panels are uniquely named while staying aligned with the floor PDU structure. However, since I’m not 100% sure about the correct RPP names for each case, it would really help if users could review and confirm or correct the RPP assignments as needed.

Let me know if that sounds good or if you'd prefer a different naming convention.

Perfect 👍 — here’s your final, detailed “Observation Report” combining both parts:

a full descriptive explanation for each asset (from your earlier messages), and

the comparative observation table for quick reference.


This version is formatted so you can copy and share it directly with your users or project leads.

Holistic Template vs Site Survey – Observation Report (Laser Location)


---

1. Utility Feed

In both the holistic template and the site survey, there are no utility feed assets recorded. No details were available from any of the source systems.


---

2. Transformer

No transformer assets are found in either the holistic template or the site survey. Both sources are consistent in this regard.


---

3. Switchboard and Associated Load Devices

No switchboard assets exist in the holistic template.
Consequently, there are no load devices connected to switchboards.
This particular switchboard asset was not found in any of the three source systems — IFP, CP&G, or FUZE — and hence is missing in both the holistic and site survey data.


---

4. Generators

The holistic sheet (sourced from the FUZE system) contains three generators, mapped at the roof or outdoor level.
However, the site survey reports only two generators physically present.
This indicates either a missing generator in field verification or incorrect tagging in one of the sources.


---

5. UPS, UPS Bank, and Load Devices

Only UPS data was provided by users.
Based on this, UPS Banks and Load Devices were derived in the holistic template.
During derivation, Amperes were calculated — for example, for a 600 kW UPS, the derived Load Device current was approximately 750 Amps, while the site survey shows 600 Amps.
This results in a difference in amperage that needs to be validated to confirm the correct value.


---

6. Floor PDU

The number of Floor PDUs in both datasets matches.
However, the rating details (kVA and Amps) differ between the holistic and site survey data.
This suggests a possible variation in design capacity versus measured field value.


---

7. RPP (Remote Power Panel)

In the site survey, the RPP is treated as a remote panel located within a Floor PDU, causing variation in both naming convention and rating.
In the holistic template, the RPP is modeled as a Floor PDU itself to maintain one-line diagram continuity.
To establish proper hierarchy, four PDU panels were created per Floor PDU:

Two panels directly mapped to the RPP, and

Two additional panels created as spares, to be used when new RPPs are added later.


Additionally, PDU Panel Breakers were created for every PDU panel to link the Floor PDU to the RPP as a sub-panel, ensuring accurate electrical mapping and connectivity.


---

8. RPP Panels

Each RPP in the holistic template has two panels — Panel A and Panel B.
In contrast, the site survey considers each of these panels as individual RPPs, resulting in differences in both hierarchy and naming convention.
This design difference arises because the site survey treats panels as stand-alone RPPs, while the holistic model groups them under a common parent RPP.


---

9. Breaker Assignment (RPP Panel Level)

In the site survey, every RPP panel has 42 poles, with three-pole breakers connected across all poles.
However, the site survey does not include cabinet connection details, breaker commands, or open/close status — these remain unclear.

In the holistic (old SICK) template, data sourced from the IFP system includes accurate breaker-to-pole mapping, indicating which poles are connected to each breaker.
Hence, the holistic template provides a more complete and structured representation of breaker connectivity than the site survey data.


---

10. HVAC (Cooling Zones)

In the holistic template, HVAC information was provided by users, specifying the room association and cooling capacity for each zone.
The holistic data lists six HVAC zones.
The site survey, however, records fourteen HVAC zones, with different zone names and cooling capacities.
This indicates either additional zones identified during field inspection or inconsistencies in user-provided data.
A reconciliation is required to align zone names, capacities, and locations across both datasets.

Summary Table – Comparative Observations

Asset Type	Holistic Template Data	Site Survey Data	Observation / Difference Identified

Utility Feed	No assets available.	No assets identified.	Both sources have no utility feed data for this location.
Transformer	No transformer assets found.	No transformer assets found.	Consistent across both datasets.
Switchboard & Load Devices	No switchboard or load device assets; not found in any source system.	No switchboard assets recorded.	Missing in both sources; asset not available in IFP, CP&G, or FUZE.
Generators	3 generators (FUZE) mapped at roof/outdoor.	2 generators physically present.	One generator missing; requires field validation.
UPS / UPS Bank / Load Devices	Derived from UPS data; 600 kW ≈ 750 A.	600 A for same UPS rating.	Amperage difference (750 A vs 600 A); validate.
Floor PDU	Same asset count.	Same asset count.	Rating (kVA / Amps) differ between datasets.
RPP	Modeled as Floor PDU to maintain one-line diagram; 4 PDU panels (2 mapped + 2 spare); PDU Panel Breakers for each panel.	Treated as remote panel inside Floor PDU.	Naming and hierarchy differences; holistic maintains structured connectivity.
RPP Panels	Two panels (A & B) per RPP.	Each panel treated as separate RPP.	Hierarchy and naming differences.
Breaker Assignment	Detailed breaker-to-pole mapping from IFP (accurate).	42 poles with 3-pole breakers; missing commands and status.	Holistic data more complete; site survey incomplete on breaker details.
HVAC (Cooling Zones)	6 zones (user input with capacity data).	14 zones with different names and capacities.	Discrepancy in zone count and capacity; requires reconciliation.

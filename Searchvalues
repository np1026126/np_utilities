Here’s how you can phrase it clearly and professionally to the users/team:

Question for Clarification

We have applied the in-service date logic for anticipated load percentage as follows:

Until the in-service date is reached → Anticipated Load % = 1

From in-service date to +6 months → Anticipated Load % = 0.5

After 6 months from in-service date → Anticipated Load % = 0


Thus, the Anticipated Load = Formalized Anticipated Load × Anticipated Load %, and the value will automatically decrease over time based on this schedule.

Now, as part of the Wireless flow, when C&D updates an equipment’s status to Installed in DC Track, that equipment is immediately marked as active.

👉 Question:
Should we continue to strictly follow the above in-service date–based logic for anticipated load reduction, or should we instead align it with the C&D Installed status update (i.e., consider that point as the effective in-service trigger)?

Do you want me to also draft this in bulleted “options” format (like Option A: follow in-service logic, Option B: follow installed status) so that it’s easier for the users to quickly decide?

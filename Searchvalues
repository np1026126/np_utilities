anks for sharing the details.
I reviewed the data you sent for the Wall TPW site, and I wanted to clarify one point to ensure we’re aligned.
The first set of data you shared appears to correspond to the Plymouth location, which is why the CLLI code does not end with J22. That Plymouth data is correct for that site, and we have already imported the same into DC Track for Plymouth.
For Wall TPW, the correct CLLI code should end with J22. The HVAC data associated with that CLLI is present in a separate sheet, and that is the data we have used for the DC Track import.
I’ve attached screenshots for reference:
Plymouth – showing that the data you shared is correctly reflected in DC Track
Wall TPW (J22) – showing the dataset that was imported into DC Track for Wall
Could you please review the attached screenshots and let us know if you see any discrepancy from your side, or if there’s any additional data you were expecting for Wall TPW?
Happy to walk through this together if needed.

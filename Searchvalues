Thanks for the clarification. Here's what you need:

âœ… Objective:

In your Floor_PDU.csv:

If a row represents a PDU (Name starts with "PDU"):

Currently: Location column has only the Site name (e.g., Alpharetta).

Expected: You want to replace the Location for such rows with the CLLI code that is present in the RPP rows (same site), without the room name or > symbol.




---

âœ… Copilot Prompt:

> I have a CSV file with power equipment data.

The column Name contains either RPP or PDU names.

The column Site contains the site name.

The column Location contains either:

For RPPs: CLLI_CODE > Room Name

For PDUs: just the site name (e.g., Alpharetta)



I want to update the Location value for PDU rows only (i.e., where Name starts with "PDU"):

For each PDU, look for an RPP with the same Site.

Extract the CLLI_CODE from the RPPâ€™s Location (i.e., the part before the > symbol).

Replace the PDUâ€™s Location with that CLLI_CODE.


Ensure that:

PDU rows no longer have the site name as the location.

RPP rows remain unchanged.

ðŸ“Œ Optional Output Column (if needed for audit):

You could also ask Copilot to create a new column Updated Location so original data remains untouched.

Let me know if you'd like a sample Python or Excel Power Query formula for this too.

Got it — I’ve added that point into the Code Lookup explanation so it’s complete and clear:

Hi James,

In our application, there are two ways to create a location:


---

1. Address Lookup – Used when the user already knows the physical address they want to create.

As the user starts typing the address, our system queries LOCUS, which returns type-ahead suggestions in a dropdown.

The user selects the correct address from this list. Once selected, LOCUS automatically populates the address details in our system.

The user then selects the location code type (SES code) and location code value (e.g., MANT, CM, etc.).

We then make a call to SILLYNet — not to validate the address, but to validate whether the entered code type + code value combination exists.

If valid, SILLYNet returns the alias name, SILLY code, GLC, site name, and LOB, which we auto-populate.

In Address Lookup, we trust the address coming from LOCUS and do not cross-check it with SILLYNet.

2. Code Lookup – Used when the user already knows the code type and code value.

For example, the user selects code type = SES code and code value = MNPCA.

We call the SILLYNet API to validate whether this code type + code value combination exists.

If valid, SILLYNet returns the alias name, LOB, and the LOCUS ID for that location.

Using this LOCUS ID, we then query LOCUS to get the correct address for that location.

We then auto-populate the address (from LOCUS) along with the alias name and LOB (from SILLYNet).

From an ELS point of view, we always get the locations from LOCUS and cross-verify them in SILLYNet. SILLYNet also maintains the LOCUS ID for every address it stores, ensuring the location data stays consistent between the two systems.

If the location is not present in SILLYNet, it is created as part of the process.

If you want, I can now condense this into a crisp explanation that highlights why in Code Lookup the address always matches — so it’s clear to the user why mismatches only happen in Address Lookup. Would you like me to do that next?

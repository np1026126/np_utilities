Hi Team,

We followed up with Sunbird architects on the panel naming and mirroring discussion, and they’ve provided updated clarification.

Sunbird’s Recommendation

Instead of Local Power Panels, Sunbird recommends using Remote Power Panels under the RPPs.

With Remote Power Panels:

Panels can have different / unique names

Mirroring is still supported

Functional behavior remains the same as expected

The only difference is in the one-line diagram representation:

Remote Panels will appear just below / outside the RPP (Floor PDU) boundary

Sunbird confirmed this is only a visual placement difference and not a functional issue

What This Means for Our Migration

By using Remote Power Panels:

We can retain the panel names as provided by users

Mirroring can still be enabled

Breaker assignments and panel behavior remain consistent

The only change is the visual placement in the one-line diagram

Confirmation Needed

Please confirm if it is acceptable to proceed with:

Remote Power Panels instead of Local Power Panels

Keeping the user-provided panel names

Accepting the slight one-line diagram placement difference as shown in Sunbird’s example

Additionally, if there are any other open questions or concerns (including edge or complex cases), please share them when you get a chance so we can address them together and align on the final approach.

Once we receive your confirmation, we’ll proceed accordingly.

Thanks,Naveen

Why this works

Correctly reflects Sunbird’s final stance

Removes earlier confusion about “no mirroring”

Clearly asks for a yes/no decision

Opens the door for remaining doubts without blocking progress

If you want, I can:

Shorten this further (very executive version)

Add a side-by-side Local vs Remote diagram note

Draft a follow-up mail if they don’t respond

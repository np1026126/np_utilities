Subject: Immediate Action Required – Dedicated Support Needed for UNO UI Performance Fix

Hi [Vendor Team / Specific Names],

As discussed, the production deployment scheduled for today could not proceed due to the pending UNO UI performance issues. This has put the production status in Jeopardy once again, despite our prior commitment to the Performance team that all performance-related issues would be addressed in this release.

While the UNO API performance issue has been resolved, the UNO UI performance issue is still pending. Given the criticality, we need dedicated focus on this item today itself.

Request: Please assign one or two dedicated resources immediately to work solely on resolving the UNO UI performance issue. We must ensure this is fixed by end of day today (Friday), as we are targeting a production deployment on Monday morning without fail.

Appreciate your immediate attention and confirmation of the assigned team members working on this.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like a slightly firmer or more polite version depending on your relationship with the vendor.

Certainly! Here's a revised and complete version of your email incorporating both the performance urgency and the regression issue from the last release:

Subject: Urgent: Immediate Attention Needed for UNO UI Performance & Critical Regression Fix

Hi [Vendor Team / Specific Names],

As discussed, the production deployment planned for today could not go live due to the pending UNO UI performance issues. This has again put the production status in Jeopardy, despite the commitment made during the last release that all performance issues would be addressed in this release.

While the UNO API performance issue has been resolved, the UNO UI performance degradation is still open and must be addressed with top priority.

Action Required:

Please assign one or two dedicated resources immediately to focus entirely on resolving the UNO UI performance issue. This must be fixed by end of day today (Friday), as we are planning to move to production on Monday morning without fail.

Additional Critical Fix – Regression in Last Release:

During the last production release, an existing behavior was unintentionally broken, resulting in users being completely blocked from proceeding. As a temporary workaround, we have assigned all network engineers as network engineer managers to allow users to continue.

However, this is not a long-term solution. This regression must also be fixed as part of this production cycle without fail.

We request immediate confirmation of the dedicated team members who will work on both these items, along with regular updates on the progress.

Thanks & Regards,

Subject: Request for QA Sign-Off ‚Äì DC4.2 Hotfix Prod Release on 06/27 (No Regression Required)

Hi [QA Manager‚Äôs Name],

As part of the upcoming DC4.2 Hotfix production release scheduled for this Friday (06/27/2025), please find below the summary of changes planned:

‚úÖ Features:

These 4 features were already part of the last sprint‚Äôs UAT and were also included in the last week‚Äôs production push. However, they remained dormant as they were pending demo and sign-off from the Solution Architect. With the approval now obtained, these features can be opened up for users:

F-15216: Update Data Model to Support Bulleted Equipment Details in 1PSC UNO Emails

F-14615: Integrate 1PSC Workflow Summary with CND

F-13393: My 1PSC Inbox for PSC Requestors

F-15219: Enhance 1PSC UI with Re-Open Functionality and Admin Edit Capability


üõ†Ô∏è Bug Fixes:

The following 3 bug fixes are newly included in this hotfix release. Relevant module-level UAT images have been shared:

NTSWSF-6461: Space details are not editable other than by network admin workgroup

PEDS-1733 (INC014461659): Filtering on .5 or 1 in Anticipated Loads calculator not working

PEDS-1060 (INC013721181, INC014556718): Space Details section of the PSCs is not populating


For this release, since the 4 features were already validated and are only being activated post-approval, and only 3 new bug fixes are being pushed (with isolated module changes), we request QA sign-off for bug-level testing only. No regression is required.

Kindly confirm your agreement to proceed accordingly.

Best regards,

Hereâ€™s a clean Slack-style draft that combines your three points in a professional but concise way:

Hi Team, quick update on TAP sites:

1. Weâ€™ve regenerated and provided HVAC details for all TAP sites, but so far we see updates reflected only for 19 sites. For the rest, the data is still pending.


2. For 8 TAP sites and 3 TAP sites (Iâ€™ll list the site names separately), the updates are still not reflected.


3. From the 8-site data shared by Andrii, we noticed that for a few sites we are not able to map the UPS â†’ UPS bank through load devices. The reason is the naming conventions â€“ we canâ€™t confirm which UPS bank is connected to a given UPS, or which RPPs are tied to the feeds. Weâ€™ve highlighted these unmapped cases in the UGL sheet for clarity.

ðŸ‘‰ Would you like me to also draft the exact Slack message listing the 8 + 3 site names inline, or do you want to keep it high-level and reference the sheet?

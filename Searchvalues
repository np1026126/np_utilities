We need clarification on a design limitation we are encountering during the NEC site migration, specifically around Power Panel naming, mirroring, and one-line diagram behavior in DCTrack.
Background
In our migration model, RPPs are treated as Floor PDUs.
RPPA and RPPB are configured as a redundant pair.
Power Panels created under RPPs are modeled as Local Power Panels, following the guidance used in previous MSC migrations.
As per DCTrack documentation and current behavior, Local Power Panels must have identical names across redundant Floor PDUs for mirroring to work.
Current Challenge
Users expect:
Panels under different RPPs to have distinct panel names (for readability and differentiation), while still supporting mirroring between RPPA and RPPB.
However:
When panels are created as Local Power Panels, DCTrack enforces identical naming for mirroring.
Creating panels as Remote Power Panels allows different names, but:
This does not align with the expected one-line diagram representation
It diverges from how RPP-based panels are modeled in our current design and prior migrations
Questions for Clarification
Is it possible in DCTrack to enable panel mirroring when panel names are different?
Specifically for panels under redundant Floor PDUs (RPPs)?
If yes, is this supported via configuration, metadata, or a different relationship type?
Is the identical naming requirement strictly enforced only for Local Power Panels?
Or is there an alternative modeling approach that still preserves:
Mirroring behavior
Correct redundancy
One-line diagram consistency
If Remote Power Panels are used instead:
Is there a recommended way to represent them so the one-line diagram remains functionally and visually correct?
Are there known limitations or trade-offs when using Remote Panels in this scenario?
From an application and reporting perspective:
Today, panel differentiation is achieved via Floor PDU (RPP) association, especially in exports and UI.
Is this the recommended approach, or is Sunbird planning/envisioning an enhancement where:
Panels can have unique names
Mirroring is driven by an identifier other than panel name?
Roadmap / Enhancement Consideration
Is there any planned or proposed enhancement in DCTrack to support:
Different panel names
While still allowing mirroring under redundant Floor PDUs?

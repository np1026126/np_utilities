Here’s a clear prompt you can use in Copilot or Gemini to compare the two CSV files (ht-bdfb.csv and ht-bdfb-dctrack.csv) and find the missing records:

Prompt for Copilot / Gemini

I have two CSV files:

1. ht-bdfb.csv → Original file with 2176 records.


2. ht-bdfb-dctrack.csv → Exported file from DCTrack with 1660 records.



I need to:

Compare both files by location name.

Identify records present in ht-bdfb.csv but missing in ht-bdfb-dctrack.csv.

Note: Some location names in ht-bdfb.csv were modified before import, so they might differ slightly in ht-bdfb-dctrack.csv. If an exact match is not found, still treat it as missing.

Generate a list of missing records in a new CSV with all original columns from ht-bdfb.csv.


Please write Python or SQL logic (or directly process if supported) to find missing records and export them as ht-bdfb-missing.csv.

If you want, I can also directly give you a Python script that will do this comparison locally and create the missing records file for you.

Do you want me to give you the ready Python code for it?

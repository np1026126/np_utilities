Here’s the updated and complete professional version of your migration note section, including your new point about connectors:

7. PDU Panel Breaker Migration

Rules / Dependencies:

Before migrating PDU Panel Breakers, both the RPP Panels and PDU Panels must be successfully created.

The import of PDU Panel Breakers depends on valid reference links to these parent components.


Known Issues / Risks:

If either the RPP Panels or PDU Panels are missing, the import will fail due to unresolved dependencies.

Mismatched or incorrect Panel Name or UUID references in the import sheet can lead to migration errors.


Action Required:

Validate that all corresponding RPP and PDU Panels exist prior to executing the breaker import.

Cross-check naming conventions and relationship mappings between breakers and panels before running the import.

8. Connector Creation

Rules / Dependencies:

Connectors are not supported through the standard import process, as there is no import sheet available for them.

All connector records must be created manually after dependent assets (e.g., PDU, RPP, UPS Bank) are in place.


Known Issues / Risks:

Missing or incorrect connectors can cause power chain visualization gaps in DCTrack.

Manual creation introduces potential for human error, so each entry must be validated carefully.


Action Required:

Create all required connectors manually in the Production environment after verifying asset dependencies.

Only 19 connector records need to be manually created in Production.

Maintain a log of created connectors with asset references for audit and traceability.

Would you like me to now merge all eight sections (UPS → Connectors) into a single polished migration document (formatted for Word or Excel) so you can send or attach it in your project update?

Subject: Urgent: Fix Required for Status Field Edit Functionality in New Screen

Hi [Vendor Team / Team Name],

As part of the recent screen enhancements delivered to production, we have identified a critical issue where the "Status" field is no longer editable. This was an existing functionality in the previous version of the screen, and it appears to have been unintentionally broken during the conversion to the new screen model.

From a user perspective, the ability to edit the status field is essential for day-to-day operations, and this regression is impacting their workflow.

We request the vendor team to please treat this as a high-priority item and ensure that the fix is included in the upcoming production release.

Please confirm once the work has been taken up and let us know the estimated timeline for the fix.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

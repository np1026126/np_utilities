Got it 👍 — here’s how you can expand your fourth question to capture the missing detail about AC flow and the Power Plant Float value:

Refined Question (Generator & HVAC Final Utilization):

> While reviewing the final utilization formulas for Generators and HVAC, I noticed that in the current DC power flow we use the field Power Plant Float (representing the voltage of the selected power plant) in the calculation.

As we extend this same formula logic to AC Power Flow, I have a few clarifications:

Since AC flow does not have a Power Plant associated with it, what should be the replacement for Power Plant Float Voltage in the formula?

Should we use a default standardized value (e.g., 208V) for AC flow calculations?

Or should this value be derived dynamically from another field or system reference?

Can you please confirm if the rest of the formula structure remains unchanged when applied to AC flow for Generators and HVAC?

👉 This wording keeps your original point (reuse of formula) but also directly asks the missing question: what to substitute for Power Plant Float when moving from DC to AC.

Would you like me to now consolidate all four questions (UPS load formula, anticipated load roll-up, UPS bank vs UPS, and this Generator/HVAC AC flow clarification) into a single professional mail draft you can send to users, instead of multiple separate queries? That way, you’ll appear very structured and proactive.

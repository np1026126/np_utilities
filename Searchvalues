Subject: Re: Update on CND–DCTrack Delta Sync

Hi Pushpa,
Hi Team,

I have updated the updatedAfter parameter to yesterday’s timestamp, so the connector will now pull only the changes that were captured from yesterday morning onwards. This ensures that we are not repeatedly syncing older data and that only the latest deltas are processed hereafter.

I will also connect with Awad today to ensure that this is treated as a one-time correction for the previous data window. Once DCTrack updates the configuration on their end, the sync will strictly follow the latest delta updates going forward, as expected.

I will share an update once the coordination with DCTrack is completed.

Regards,
Naveen Prasad

If you want, I can refine it further depending on tone — more formal, more concise, or with technical details included.

Subject: Breaker assignment blocked due to cabinet naming/migration gaps – request to correct in PLE

Hi Suresh and Jason,

During breaker assignment validation based on your cabinet inputs, we noticed issues with the cabinet data:

A few cabinets are missing in the target environment.

Some cabinets were migrated with incorrect names, so they don’t match the expected references in our mapping.

Because of this, G-flow and AC-flow assignments are blocked. In our latest pass (“Winter” set), we were able to proceed on most items, but ~350 assignments are currently impacted by the above gaps.


Request:
Please confirm that we can correct the cabinet names and add the missing cabinets in PLE so we can complete breaker assignment and resume the flows.

Planned fix in PLE (once approved):

1. Load the missing cabinets.


2. Normalize/rename the cabinet records to the agreed naming convention.


3. Re-run breaker assignment for the affected set and validate G & AC flows.



I’ve attached the list of impacted cabinets (missing/renamed) and the assignment report for reference.

Please let me know if you’d like us to proceed in PLE, or if you prefer an alternate environment/change window. We’re ready to start as soon as we get your go-ahead.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also draft the attached “impacted cabinets” list in a clean CSV format.

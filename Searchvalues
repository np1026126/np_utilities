Perfect 👍 — here’s the exact Copilot prompt you can paste right after importing your Excel file into your Python or Jupyter project (or when you open it in VS Code with Copilot enabled).

💡 Exact Copilot Prompt

> I have imported an Excel file with two columns — psc_location (column A) and location (column B).

Each value in psc_location is in the format: SILLYCODE > ROOM NAME (for example: ADLPMDMT > BATTERY PLANT A 111).
The location column contains similar data but may have variations such as:

Missing letters or words (e.g., BATTERY ROOM instead of BATTERY ROOM A)

Extra characters like /, ,, or spaces

Case differences.


I want to write a Python script using pandas and fuzzywuzzy (or rapidfuzz) that:

1. Extracts only the room name part (after '>') from each psc_location value.


2. Compares this extracted room name with the location column value.


3. Calculates a similarity percentage for each comparison.


4. Creates two new columns:

Match_Percentage → shows the similarity score (0–100)

Match_Result → shows:

"Matched" if the score ≥ 80

"Needs Review" if score is between 50–79

"Not Present" if score < 50.




5. Finally, exports the result into a new Excel file called matched_locations.xlsx with all these columns.



Please generate clean, commented Python code that does this efficiently for a few thousand rows.

✅ Optional addition (if you want a shorter version for quick use):

> Compare column A (psc_location) and column B (location) by matching the room names after '>'.
Show match percentage using fuzzy match and mark rows as "Matched" (≥80%), "Needs Review" (50–79%), or "Not Present" (<50%).
Write results into a new Excel file.

Would you like me to give you the ready-to-use Python code (the one Copilot would generate for this prompt) so you can just run it directly if needed?

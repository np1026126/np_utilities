Excellent — this is a very realistic question and you’re thinking about it the right way 👏

Let’s break this down into what you’re trying to do and then I’ll give you the exact Slack message you can send.

🧩 Situation summary (in your words, simplified)

You have an Excel breaker assignment sheet exported from IFP.

It shows:

Location → (e.g., “CHRXHL1 Switch Room 900”)

Breaker state → “Open”

Starting position, Rated Amps, etc.

Comment / Description → mentions something like “Cab 39801Z DC-60QA1-P1 CTX A1 Fed” (which is the cabinet name).


From this, you see a mismatch:

The breaker’s state is “Open” → meaning not connected.

But in comment/description, it says it’s connected (mapped) to a cabinet.



So you want to ask the IFP team to verify in the IFP UI whether these breakers are actually assigned to the cabinets or not, since you don’t have production access.

🗣️ What you want to clarify to them

You need to ask politely and clearly:

1. Whether breakers showing as “Open” in the extract are really unassigned in the live system.


2. Or if they’re already mapped to the cabinet (as the comment/description says).


3. Basically: which one should we trust — the breaker status or the comment mapping?

💬 Slack message draft (professional & clear)

Here’s a ready-to-send message you can paste in Slack 👇

Hey [Name],

I was checking the breaker assignment data that we exported from IFP.
For several entries, I noticed something confusing — the breaker status is coming as “Open”, but in the comment/description column, it’s mentioned that the breaker is already connected to a specific cabinet (for example: “Cab 39801Z DC-60QA1-P1 CTX A1 Fed”).

Could you please help check this in the live IFP production UI once?
Specifically:

Are these breakers actually assigned/mapped to the respective cabinets?

Or are they really open/unassigned as per the system status?


This will help us confirm whether we should trust the “Breaker State” field or the “Comment” description for cabinet mapping.

Thanks a lot for checking this!

✨ Optional short version (for chat-style Slack)

> Hi [Name], quick help needed — in the IFP export, some breakers show “Open” in status but the comment mentions a cabinet (e.g., “Cab 39801Z…”).
Can you please check in live IFP if those breakers are actually mapped to the cabinets or still open/unassigned?
Just want to be sure whether to rely on the status or the description field.

Would you like me to make it sound more formal (for manager-level) or friendly (for teammate-level) before you send it?

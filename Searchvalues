Here are 3 professional Slack message options you can choose from, depending on how formal you want to be. All of them clearly say:

where the data is,

what was added,

what period it covers,

and what they should look at.



---

✅ Option 1 – Best Balance (Recommended for Manager + Architect)

> Hi <Manager Name> and <Architect Name>,

I’ve added the November month metrics as a new tab titled “November Month Status” in the existing Google Sheet.

This tab includes: • Area, Market, and Division breakdown
• Total PSCs
• Current status-wise count (Completed / In-Progress / etc.)

Please have a look and let me know if any refinements are needed.

✅ Option 2 – Slightly More Formal (Leadership-Friendly)

> Hi <Manager Name> and <Architect Name>,

The November 2024 PSC metrics have been updated in the existing Google Sheet under a new tab named “November Month Status”.

The data includes Area / Market / Division-wise segregation along with total PSCs and current status counts.

Please review and let me know if any additional views are required.

✅ Option 3 – Short & Crisp (If Slack Culture is Minimal)

> Hi <Manager Name>, <Architect Name> —
I’ve added the November metrics in the Google Sheet under “November Month Status” with Area/Market/Division-wise breakup and PSC status counts.
Let me know if you’d like this sliced differently.

✅ Tip for Slack

If you are attaching the Google Sheet link, you can add this one line at the end:

> Google Sheet link attached for reference.

If you want, tell me:

your manager’s style (formal / casual), or

whether this is going into a public channel or DM


and I’ll fine-tune the message exactly to your situation.

Hi [Manager’s Manager’s Name],

As per the review of the 10 asset categories migrated by our onshore counterpart, although they mentioned that all were migrated with few fallouts, the actual fallout percentage is quite high. Here’s the summary:

Mirroring: ~100% fallout

Redundancy Pair: 266 fallouts (~31%)

RPP Panel: ~100% fallout

RPP: 64 fallouts (~5%)

PDU Panels: 1408 fallouts (~94%)

Load Devices: ~100% fallout


Overall, ~70% of total records ended up as fallouts, indicating that a majority of the assets didn’t migrate successfully.
We’ll need to analyze these fallout cases to identify and fix the issues before proceeding with further migration.

Thanks,
[Your Name]

Subject: High Fallout Counts Observed in Recent Asset Migration – Follow-up Actions Planned

Dear [Manager’s Manager’s Name],

During the review of the recent 10 asset categories migrated by our onshore counterpart, it was mentioned that all assets were migrated with minimal fallouts. However, upon analysis, the actual fallout percentage appears to be quite high. Please find the summary below:

Asset Type	Fallout %	Remarks

Mirroring	~100%	Entire set resulted in fallout
Redundancy Pair	~31%	266 fallouts observed
RPP Panel	~100%	Entire set resulted in fallout
RPP	~5%	64 fallouts observed
PDU Panels	~94%	Major portion resulted in fallout
Load Devices	~100%	Entire set resulted in fallout


Overall, out of a total of 10,600 records, around 6,769 have fallen out — indicating an overall fallout rate of nearly 70%.

I will be focusing on these fallout cases to analyze and address the root causes. The objective is to resolve these issues and ensure a smoother and more successful migration in the upcoming phases.

Please let me know if you’d like me to share a detailed breakdown or specific error patterns identified so far.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Would you like me to make this into a Slack message version too (shorter, more conversational, but keeping the same tone)? I can tailor it so you can just paste it directly in your team’s Slack channel.

Would you like me to make this message slightly more formal and structured (for a manager-to-manager Slack post, suitable for sharing in a channel)?

Here’s a clear and professional Slack message you can post to clarify the responsibility and refer to the CNB team’s action item (based on the emails you shared):

Slack Message Draft:

> Hi @Shridhar @Howard,

Regarding the DC-TRAC ↔ CNB cabinet sync issue, the blocker was assigned to the 1PSC team. However, as per the update from Sunbird, the existing CNB API needs to include a new parameter – code, which should hold the location value concatenated with the room name (using the '>' symbol) for the sync to work correctly.

Even Shivakumar from the CNB team has confirmed this and requested Rajesh from his team to work on adding this parameter in the CNB API response.

Hence, the next action lies with the CNB team to modify the API response accordingly. Once this change is done, the sync from DC-TRAC should work as expected.

Tagging here for visibility and to track the progress.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a shorter version (for a group chat) or keep this detailed format (for a project channel like #dctrack-integration)?

Here is a clear and effective prompt you can give to Copilot Agent to regenerate the RPP query using the same structure as the PDU query:


---

✅ Prompt to Copilot Agent:

> I have already created a MySQL query for the PDU asset, which maps CP&G columns to the required DC Track columns. Now, I want to recreate the query for the RPP asset using the exact same set of DC Track columns as used in the PDU query.

Please use the PDU query as the reference for column mappings and structure. The only change should be in the source:

For PDU, the source is UPS

For RPP, the source is PDU


For now, you can leave the source field empty in the RPP query output – it will be provided later by the user.

Also note: The current RPP query was based on PowerPanel logic with different column names. Please ignore that and regenerate the RPP query using the PDU column structure instead.

Input:

PDU Query:


-- paste the PDU query here

Current RPP (PowerPanel) Query:


-- paste the current RPP query here

Expected Output:

A new RPP query using the PDU’s column structure

Same output fields and format as the PDU query

Only difference: source would be empty or to be filled later by user

Let me know if you also want to include a sample of the DC Track CSV column mappings in the prompt, or if you'd like me to refine this for a specific use case like bulk generation.

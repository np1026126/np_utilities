Here is the combined description + single tabular section for BDFB Panel, exactly in the format you requested — short description first, followed by one clean table.

You can copy-paste this directly.

✅ BDFB PANEL – Clarification

Description

For BDFB Panels, there are three fields that define the physical placement of the panel inside the BDFB:

U-Position (vertical positioning – Above/Below)

Order L to R (horizontal order – panel position from left to right)

Installation Date


In the current template, all three fields are repeated twice. Only one instance of each should be kept.

U-Position should specify whether the panel is mounted Above or Below.
Order L to R should contain the panel order number (1, 2, 3, etc.) indicating its position from left to right.

If you'd like, I can now prepare the BDFB Panel Breakers section in the same style.

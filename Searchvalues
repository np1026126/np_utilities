Sure! Here's the exact prompt you can give to GitHub Copilot (or Copilot Workspace/Chat) assuming it already has access to all your asset CSVs, SQL files, and holistic templates:


---

> Prompt to Copilot:

"Iâ€™ve uploaded a CSV file that lists the asset names under the column 'TAB HEADERS' from our DC-TRAC migration. You already have access to all the holistic templates, SQL queries, and asset data from IFP, CP&G, FUSE, and DC-TRAC.

Using all this context, generate a clear, user-friendly one-liner description for each asset listed in the CSV.
The description should help non-technical users quickly understand what each asset represents in the data center, avoiding technical terms unless absolutely necessary."

This is concise and tuned specifically for your use case. Let me know if you want a version for ChatGPT Copilot Labs as well.

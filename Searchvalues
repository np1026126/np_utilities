Got it. You want the email to clearly mention that the Monday deadline was committed by the developers themselves, and since this was the commitment given to users, their support over the weekend is essential to honor it.

Hereâ€™s a polished professional version for you:

Subject: Support Required Over the Weekend for Calculation Feature Completion

Dear Team,

As you know, we have committed to completing the Calculation Feature by Monday. This commitment was given by the development team itself, and we have communicated this date to the users accordingly.

However, given the recent scope changes and the current progress, it appears that completing the work within the weekday timelines alone may not be feasible. Therefore, to honor the commitment made by the team and meet the Monday deadline, I request your support over the weekend to complete the pending tasks.

Your cooperation is essential to ensure that we deliver this feature on time and as promised to the users.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can prepare a slightly more persuasive version that motivates the team positively rather than sounding like a demand. Would you like me to draft that?

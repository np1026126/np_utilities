Subject: Floor PDU Power Chain – Update on Panel Configuration

Dear Team,

Following today’s discussion and based on the latest inputs, we are aligning our floor PDU build as per the updated recommendation.

Previously, we created a single local panel within the floor PDU containing 12 poles (4 x 3-pole 600A breakers), sized to 1200A as per the provided diagram. Each breaker was intended to feed separate RPPs (considered as floor PDUs), adhering to the original instruction.

However, during today’s call, a change was proposed to improve clarity and alignment with system standards. Instead of a single panel housing all 4 breakers, we will now create 4 separate panels, each containing one 600A breaker. Each breaker will independently feed one RPP.

This revised approach was discussed with James Hill and Andrew, and they have confirmed alignment with the proposed structure.

Since this design change has now been incorporated, may I kindly request you to confirm if we can proceed with this as the final approach? Please let me know if there are any further concerns or inputs.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Designation / Team, if needed]

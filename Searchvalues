Subject: Performance Feedback Summary – Past Six Months

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I would like to share a summary of the key performance concerns observed over the past six months regarding [Employee's Name]'s contributions, particularly in relation to backend development tasks and collaborative project responsibilities:

1. Lack of Technical Readiness for Role Level:
Despite being onboarded as an Engineer 3, there have been repeated challenges in grasping foundational backend concepts including scheduler implementation, Liquibase usage for DB changes, and writing testable, maintainable code. Several basic technical doubts continue to be raised even after multiple clarifications and walkthroughs.

2. Repetitive Deployment Issues:
Her code changes, especially around Liquibase, have frequently caused deployment failures (table creation/deletion and data type mismatches). These incidents have blocked other developers from pushing their modules, directly impacting the release schedule and cross-team coordination.

3. Test Coverage Deficiencies Causing Sonar Failures:
For tasks such as the scheduler, the test cases written have failed to meet the expected coverage (90%), leading to SonarQube failures. This has also impacted vendor teams who are unable to proceed with their builds due to unresolved Sonar issues.

4. Incomplete Task Delivery Over Extended Periods:
Several deliverables, including the scheduler module, remain incomplete despite multiple sprints. The same task has spanned five to six sprints without closure, significantly affecting overall velocity and team output.

5. High Dependency and Repetition of Doubts:
There is a consistent pattern of raising the same doubts across different leads, often expecting exact code-level answers instead of leveraging guidance provided. This has caused delays and confusion within the team.

Overall, the performance has not aligned with expectations for the given role level, and it continues to impact the team’s productivity and momentum. This feedback is intended to highlight the gaps and provide clarity for improvement moving forward.

Regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Role/Team]

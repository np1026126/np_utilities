Based on the screenshot and your explanation, here is a professional Sunbird ticket content for the second issue (bulk edit for room/location is not functioning as expected):


---

‚úÖ Ticket Title / Summary:

Bulk Edit for 'Location' Field Not Available for Floor PDU and RPP Classes


---

üìù Detailed Description (to be used in the ticket body):

We are currently facing an issue with the bulk edit functionality in DCTrack (Sunbird platform), specifically when attempting to update the 'Location' field for multiple assets of class type Floor PDU (and similarly for RPPs).

While selecting multiple items and using the Bulk Edit > Up to 5 Fields option, the 'Location' field does not appear as an editable option. Only "Location Ref" is available under standard fields, which is not sufficient for our use case.

This limitation forces us to edit each item's location individually through the UI, significantly slowing down the data correction process ‚Äî especially critical during ongoing large-scale migrations and room alignment corrections.


---

üîß Expected Functionality:

We request the ability to:

Bulk select multiple Floor PDUs or RPPs

Edit their Location field in one action using Bulk Edit

Ensure that the actual room location (not just location reference) is editable in this bulk mode



---

üì∏ Screenshot Reference:

Attached screenshot shows the issue:
‚û§ Bulk Edit > Field to Edit dropdown does not list 'Location', only 'Location Ref'
‚û§ Assets selected belong to Floor PDU class, which require mass location updates



---

üìç Business Impact:

This is critical for efficient room mapping during data migration and correction.

Manually updating location for hundreds of PDUs/RPPs is not scalable.

This directly affects our ability to maintain data accuracy and meet project timelines.

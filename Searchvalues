This is to bring to your attention that the two tickets assigned to your team last Friday have not yet been completed. As of today, we have not received any resolution or update, and unfortunately, the tickets have not even progressed to the SIT phase.

Please note that our production release is scheduled for tomorrow, and due to this delay, the release is now at risk. This is a critical concern, and we expected the assigned work to be completed well within the timeline to avoid such jeopardy.

We request your team to take immediate action and provide a clear update on the current status of both tickets, along with the earliest possible resolution timeline.

Looking forward to your prompt response and necessary action.

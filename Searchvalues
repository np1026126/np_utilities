Prompt to paste in Gemini:
I have a Google Sheet with PAC request data.
Columns are:
Created Date (column D)
Closed Date (column E)
Days Taken (column F, already calculated as Closed Date – Created Date)
Please do the following in this same Google Sheet:
Create a new column called Turnaround Bucket and classify each row based on Days Taken as:
Within 5 days (≤5)
5–10 days
10–20 days
More than 20 days
Create a Pivot Table that shows:
Rows → Turnaround Bucket
Values → COUNT of PAC ID (or row count)
Create a chart (column or donut) from the pivot table showing the count of PACs in each bucket.
Apply colors:
Green → Within 5 days
Yellow → 5–10 days
Orange → 10–20 days
Red → More than 20 days
Place the pivot table and chart in a new sheet named PAC Turnaround Summary.
Do not change existing data. Use formulas where required.

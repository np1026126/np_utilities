Based on your second and third screenshots (which detail the issues and assumptions per asset), here is the professional content you can enter into your slide under the "Asset" and "Data Migration Issues" columns:

S. No.	Asset	Data Migration Issues

1	UPS and Floor PDU	- UPS entries were created based on the PDU naming convention from CP&G.<br> - KW/KVA values were manually populated based on user-provided one-line diagrams.<br> - Inconsistencies found between UPS and Floor PDU values (e.g., UPS rated at 250kW vs. PDU at 225kW).<br> - Load Devices and UPS Banks were generated with assumed PF (0.9) due to missing source data.<br> - This may impact power flow accuracy in dcTrack.
2	UPS Bank	- No source data available; assets created only in dcTrack.<br> - Created 2 UPS Banks assuming grouping based on PDU name prefix (e.g., A and B).<br> - Rating Amps derived assuming Power Factor = 0.9.
3	Load Device	- Not available in any source system.<br> - Created in dcTrack to connect UPS to PDU.<br> - Amp values derived using same assumptions as UPS bank.
4	RPP (as Floor PDU)	- RPPs are treated as PDUs for schema alignment.<br> - Still under discussion if this approach is acceptable or if RPP should be created with internal panels.<br> - Transformer connection logic impacted due to this schema mapping.
5	DC Panel	- DC Panel not found in CP&G, IFP, or FUZE.<br> - Dummy panel created in dcTrack to allow BDFB import.<br> - Mapping made to allow logical BDFB flow continuation.
6	Generator	- Rating (KW, KVA, Amps) derived using formulas from GEN_SIZE due to missing rated values.<br> - If assumptions are incorrect, it may lead to data integrity issues.
7	Battery	- "Belongs To" field (UPS/Plant) often marked as 'None'.<br> - No association possible between battery and plant/UPS.<br> - Required fields such as String Index, String Number are missing in some entries.<br> - Mapping logic from FUZE broken due to incomplete hierarchy.
8	HVAC	- Missing fields like Zone Load and TotalTonsNonEquipHeat from FUZE.<br> - Make/model details not available.<br> - Users advised not to load data until FUZE exports are corrected.
9	Room Details	- Several assets (from CP&G and FUZE) have no room assigned.<br> - Temporarily assigned to "Roof" in dcTrack; users must validate and update room assignments post-migration.

üì¢ Subject: Data Validation ‚Äì UPS and PDU/RPP Rating Mismatch & Missing Power Flow Inputs

Dear Team,

During our validation of the power chain data for the Windsor site, we identified two critical issues that are preventing successful import and linking of assets in DCTrack:


---

‚ö†Ô∏è 1. Rating Mismatch Between UPS and PDU/RPP:

The provided UPS units have a maximum rating of approx. 55.6 kVA (51‚Äì57 kW).

However, the PDUs and RPPs intended to be linked have ratings of 225‚Äì300 kVA and 400‚Äì500 A.

This presents a capacity mismatch where the UPS cannot support the load of the connected PDU or RPP based on current data.

As a result, we cannot link these assets in DCTrack, and importing both would cause validation failures due to incorrect power flow modeling.



---

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. Missing Required Inputs for Power Flow Calculation:

For the power chain and calculations to work correctly in DCTrack:

The UPS must be linked to the PDU via accurate Power Fed From and Source (UPS Bank) fields.

The UPS Bank and Load Device (e.g., Load PDU, panel, etc.) must also be provided so that the complete path of power flow is defined.

The PDU must have the correct UPS source information, without which the power spectrum cannot be calculated and relationships cannot be established.


In short, UPS ‚Üí UPS Bank ‚Üí Load Device ‚Üí PDU must all be present and accurately linked for power chain integrity and calculation logic to function properly.



---

‚úÖ Next Steps:

Please review and:

Correct the UPS or PDU/RPP ratings as per real site data.

Ensure the UPS Bank, Load Device, and Power Fed From fields are properly populated for each corresponding PDU.

Share the revised dataset for us to proceed with upload and validation.

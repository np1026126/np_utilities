Got it 👍 Here’s the refined question including UPS, PDU, and RPP:

Draft Question to Users:

> I had a clarification on the formulas provided:

For the Total UPS Load, the definition makes sense since it uses Anticipated Load + Previous Anticipated Output (kW), which effectively gives both the current and anticipated load.

For the Total PDU Load, the formula given is Current Polled Amps of PDU from UCS or CPNG. This seems to only represent the current load, without factoring in the anticipated load. Should the anticipated load also be included here, similar to the UPS calculation?

For the Total RPP Load, the formula provided is (Continuous Rating × 1.73 × RPP Voltage) – RPP Consumed Load. This also appears to capture only the consumed load and not the anticipated load. Could you confirm if that is correct, or should anticipated load also be included at the RPP level?

Do you also want me to condense this into a short Slack-friendly version (2–3 crisp lines) that you can directly paste, so you don’t have to explain the whole thing in detail every time?

Good point 👍 — this should be added as a separate, explicit reference section so users clearly know where to look and what exactly you have highlighted.
Where to add this in the mail
Add it after the issue list (or just before the “Summary” section).
That’s the best place because:
By then, the user already understands the problems
This section tells them exactly where the evidence/examples are
📌 Recommended New Section to Add
You can add a new section like this:
7. Reference Google Sheet – Highlighted Issue Examples
To make the above points clearer, we have created a Google Sheet where:
Specific rows with Silicode conflicts
RPP / Panel naming mismatches
Hierarchy and ISP comparison issues are clearly copied and highlighted.
This sheet contains only the impacted data, extracted from the user-provided files and compared against ISP, for easier review.
Action required:
Please review the Google Sheet using the link below and confirm:
Whether the highlighted data can be corrected as suggested, or
If an alternate approach should be followed for NEC sites.
🔗 Google Sheet URL: <paste your Google Sheet link here>
🔧 How it fits into your existing mail
Your flow will become:
Silicode conflict
RPP A/B panel naming issue
Incorrect hierarchy (RPP as panel)
Unmapped RPP panels & breakers
Room name mismatch
Naming convention differences
👉 7. Reference Google Sheet (new section)
➡️ Summary / Next steps
This makes the mail:
Clear
Defensible (you’ve shared evidence)
Easy for business/users to respond
✨ Optional stronger line (if you want)
If you want to be a bit firmer, you can add this sentence:
“The migration blockers listed above directly correspond to the highlighted rows in the attached Google Sheet.”
If you want, next I can:
Merge this section cleanly into the full mail and resend the final version, or
Help you write a short WhatsApp / Slack message to accompany the mail saying “details are in the Google Sheet”.

Subject: Re: Rack UUID Update Validation

Hi Chris,

As part of the review in the provided Google Sheet (RAC migration in PLE), I verified the ID column values against the fp_attach_space_inv_meta_data table.

For the Anchorage and Windsor sites, I was able to locate the corresponding entries and confirm that the rack_uuid values were correctly updated in the metadata table.
However, I wasn’t able to check for all the other sites at this point. Based on the data observed, the remaining sites’ details appear to have been migrated successfully.

Please let me know if you’d like me to validate any specific sites in detail.

Thanks & Regards,
Naveen Prasad

Would you like me to make it sound a bit more formal and concise (for senior management visibility), or keep it casual and detailed like this version for internal team communication?

Subject: Response to Ticket #71706 – PDU-Level Real-Time Power Readings

Hi Howard,

Thanks for your response.

To clarify, we are not expecting dcTrack to collect or calculate real-time PDU power readings directly. Instead, we have an internal application that will:

1. Migrate the PDU assets from CPNG into dcTrack.


2. Continuously fetch real-time power utilization readings (kW, kVA, Phase A/B/C loads) from the CPNG source system.


3. Update those readings into dcTrack for each corresponding PDU.



For this to work, dcTrack must have the required fields available at the PDU level to store and display these values. Specifically, we need fields for:

kW (Actual & Budgeted)

kVA (Actual & Budgeted)

Phase A load

Phase B load

Phase C load

Utilization percentage


At present, we observe these fields are only available at the RPP level, but not at the PDU level. We are requesting that similar data fields be made available at the PDU level to support our external integration.

Please let us know if this enhancement can be supported or configured.

Best regards,
Naveen Prasad

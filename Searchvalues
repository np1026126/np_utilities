Got it! Here's the refined Copilot prompt you can use to upload the full PDF and ask it to extract only the Generator, HVAC, Plant, and Switchgear details, then explain those in a clear and simple way like you're preparing a document for a 20-year-old beginner in your team:

✅ Copilot Prompt to Extract and Explain Generator, HVAC, Plant & Switchgear

> I am uploading a PDF document that contains around 23 sheets/pages related to DCTrack configuration and calculations (used by the Sunbird team for inventory management of power systems like Generators, HVAC, Plants, Switchgear, Fuel Tanks, AC Mains, etc.).

Please perform the following:

1. Read the entire document.


2. Extract only the relevant information related to:

Generator

HVAC

Plant

Switchgear



3. For each of the above:

What fields are used in the system (e.g., kW, voltages, capacities)?

What formulas or calculations are used? (e.g., Total Gen Load kW, Redundant Rectifier logic)

What values are expected for these fields?

How does this item function in the DCTrack system?



4. Generate a detailed and beginner-friendly explanation, as if explaining to a 20-year-old team member who is new to DCTrack and doesn't have deep domain knowledge.


5. Output a well-formatted document or markdown that I can share with my team for easy understanding.

Let me know if you want the explanation broken down into sections (like for presentation slides or Confluence notes), and I’ll tailor it accordingly.

This prompt ensures Copilot knows exactly what to extract, how to compare using only the part before '>', and what output to return.


The updated version of New_Load_Panel_Breaker_Sheet.csv with Columns N and M populated wherever applicable.

Let me know if you want to script this in Python or Excel formulas as well.

Here’s a professional, clear, and defensible draft you can send — it explains the root cause, puts context that the source was IFP (so not a process error on your end), and outlines the corrective action you’re taking:

Thanks, Kirk, for sharing the FUZE CLLI details.

To clarify, for this migration initiative we have been sourcing all data from IFP as the system of record, since the scope originated from the IFP migration effort. The queries for asset extraction were designed based on the IFP database structure and values.

In IFP, the SAP short name/CLLI code for MSC Charlotte and MSC North Mecklenburg is stored as the same value, which is why both locations returned identical asset data during our extraction. This is consistent with the data we see in the IFP site table (screenshot attached for reference).

When we processed the results, the duplicate entries for the same CLLI were de-duplicated during the upload, which caused one site (Charlotte) to be excluded. This is not due to an extraction miss, but rather due to the way the short CLLI is maintained in IFP for these two locations.

Next steps:

We will run a corrected extraction by end of day today, ensuring that both sites are explicitly captured.

For this correction, we will bypass short-name-only matching and ensure that each site’s full CLLI from the validated source list is used in the filter logic.

We will also compare short CLLIs across the 54 SAP sites to identify any other overlaps and apply the same fix where required.


If the CLLI values for Charlotte and North Mecklenburg are expected to be distinct going forward, we recommend having these updated in IFP to avoid similar issues in downstream processes.

We’ll share the corrected sheet once the rerun is complete.

This wording:

Clearly says your logic matched the source system (so no blame falls on you).

Explains why the duplication happened.

Commits to a fix with a clear timeline.

Suggests a data correction in IFP so the same issue doesn’t recur.


If you want, I can also prepare the exact one-liner you can attach under the IFP table screenshot so it’s obvious the source data had the same CLLI for both sites. That will make your case watertight.

Here is a clean, professional message you can send to your manager, summarizing the user activity trend, post-migration drop, and the latest query findings, along with how to refer to the screenshots you have.

I’ll write it exactly in the tone expected in Verizon leadership communication:

✅ Message to Manager (Copy–Paste-Friendly)

Hi Jay,

As requested, I have pulled the latest user activity metrics for the last few weeks.

1. PSC Engineers – Wireless (WLS) User Activity

November (2025-11): 129 active users

December (till date): 18 active users


I have attached the screenshot showing the monthly WLS trend, where the post-launch activity clearly peaks at 129 users in November, followed by the expected reduction in December due to partial-month usage.

2. IFP to PSC Migration – MSC User Trend (Post Migration Impact)

From the IFP activity snapshot (MRC only):

Before migration: User count consistently around 412–441

After migration: Reduced to 286


This shows a significant dip in MSC active users post-migration.

I have attached the chart highlighting this exact drop for quick reference.

3. Latest Query Results

The numbers provided above are based on the latest updated query executed today. These counts reflect the most accurate trend of user activity post PSC launch.

Please let me know if you need:

A weekly breakdown

A comparative chart (IFP vs PSC)

Segregation by site group or time window


I can get that pulled as well.

Thanks,
Naveen

✅ If You Want to Add Screenshot Captions

You can use these small captions below each screenshot:

Caption 1 – WLS Monthly Activity

> “Wireless PSC user activity trend – 129 users in Nov, 18 users in Dec (till date).”



Caption 2 – IFP MSC Activity (MRC Only)

> “IFP MSC user activity dropped from 441 → 286 after migration.”

⭐ If you want, I can also prepare:

✔ A clean combined summary chart
✔ A PPT slide with these numbers
✔ A text block for your WhatsApp / Slack message
✔ A table comparing old vs new values

Just tell me what format your manager prefers.

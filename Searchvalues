Below is a clean, structured, professional explanation you can directly copy-paste to the users as a response.
I have rewritten your points clearly, corrected the technical wording, and formatted them asset-wise so it’s easy for them to understand.

✅ Response to Questions on Asset-Specific Fields

Below are the clarifications for each asset type based on your questions:


---

1️⃣ Floor PDU – What should be filled in the “Source” field?

For Floor PDU, the Source field should be populated as:

UPS Bank Name / Load Device Name

This means:

The UPS Bank feeding the PDU

The specific load device (for example, RPP or Panel) through which the PDU is electrically connected


✔ This gives the correct hierarchical power-chain path: Generator → UPS → UPS Bank → Load Device → Floor PDU


---

2️⃣ Generators – Custom Field “Max Load” & “LoadDT”

Custom Field – Max Load

This represents the maximum power load (capacity) that the generator can support.

This field was introduced by wireline teams.

If you know the generator's rated capacity, please enter it.

If not available, you may leave it blank.


Custom Field – LoadDT (mm/dd/yyyy)

This is a custom date field used by wireline.

If the date is not known, leave it empty.

It is not mandatory.


✔ It is completely fine if both fields remain blank.


---

3️⃣ Fuel Tank – Custom Fields “Fuel Level (Gals)” & “Owner”

These custom fields were added by wireline, not wireless.

Fuel Level (Gals)

Represents the stored fuel volume.

This may be a dropdown field.

I will verify the allowed values and confirm.


Fuel Tank Owner

Represents who owns the fuel tank (Wireless / Wireline / Facility).

I will confirm the exact options available.


✔ For now, if not sure, you may leave both fields blank.


---

4️⃣ BDFB – Table Version, Weight Capacity, Custom Fields

Fields Not Required

The following fields are not required and can be left empty:

Table Version

Weight Capacity

Custom Field – Number of Loads

Custom Field – Equipment Served

Custom Field – Project ID

Custom Field – BDFB Panel ID

Rails Used

Orientation

Order


Fields Required

Only Installed Position / U-Position must be filled.

The BDFB U-position indicates:

Whether the BDFB is mounted above or below in the rack/cabinet

The relative vertical placement

Typically:

Above (Top)

Below (Bottom)



If unsure:
✔ Use the rack diagram or facility drawings to confirm
✔ Orientation / rails / order are not mandatory for migration


---

5️⃣ Batteries – Model, Make, Installation Date

Battery Model / Make

Use the standard model name listed in our DC-Track inventory.

If the make/model you have is not in our list, share it with us.

We will request DC-Track Support to add it.



Installation Date

Not mandatory

If you do not know the exact date: ✔ You may leave it blank
✔ Or provide a reasonable placeholder date


No validation will fail because of missing installation dates.


---

✅ Summary (Short Version for Quick Reference)

Floor PDU Source: UPS Bank / Load Device

Generator fields: Both custom fields are optional

Fuel Tank: Both fields optional; I will confirm dropdown values

BDFB: Only U-position is needed; all other fields optional

Battery Model: Use correct make/model; add missing ones via support

Battery Installation Date: Optional

If you want, I can also prepare this in email format, bullet format, or a version you can speak in a meeting.

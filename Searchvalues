Slack Message Draft (Final Version):

Hi @Howard R Crump III @Gnanapushpam Karthic Kumar ðŸ‘‹

I wanted to provide an update and seek clarification regarding the Budget Load calculation issue and related cabinet assignment behavior.

Currently, the Budget Load is not updating as expected, and hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve observed during testing:

When a cabinet is first assigned to a breaker, a dummy load record is automatically created at the cabinet level â€” this triggers the Budget Load computation. âœ…

However, once a breaker is already assigned, and we either reassign a new cabinet or reassign the same cabinet, the dummy load creation logic doesnâ€™t trigger again, resulting in Budget Load values not getting updated or split properly.

Additionally, when a cabinet is in Install state, assigning it to a breaker does not populate the Budget Load values, since the dummy loads are not being created for cabinets in that state.

The dummy load creation currently happens only when the cabinet is in Planned status, which appears to be why the Budget Load field remains blank for installed cabinets.



From a UI perspective, I also noticed:

Once a breaker is assigned to a cabinet, Iâ€™m unable to edit or reassign that cabinet.

The delete icon (visible for breakers assigned to other items) is missing when a breaker is assigned to a cabinet.

Because of this, Iâ€™m forced to delete the entire breaker to make any cabinet-related changes.


Iâ€™ve already created two bug tickets for these issues â€”

1. Unable to edit or reassign cabinets once a breaker is linked.


2. Delete icon missing for breakers associated with cabinets.



Iâ€™m assuming the dummy load creation logic is the root cause behind both the Budget Load not updating and the UI reassignment restriction.

Could you please confirm if this behavior is known or if any backend trigger or rule adjustment is required for reassignments and for Install state cabinets?
If needed, I can walk through this scenario on a short call to demonstrate the exact issue.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to include placeholders for the two ticket IDs and titles (so you can paste them once you have them from Canvas or Jira)?

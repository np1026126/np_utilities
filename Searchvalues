Perfect use case 👍
Here’s a ready-to-copy prompt you can give directly to GitHub Copilot Chat (Agent / Chat mode in VS Code) to extract all logger.info usages into a single shareable sheet.

✅ Copilot Prompt – Find all logger.info usages & export as sheet

> Prompt to paste in Copilot Chat:

You are acting as a code analysis assistant.

Please scan the entire workspace / application and find all occurrences of logger.info(...) across all source files.

For each occurrence, extract and present the details in a tabular format suitable for Excel or Google Sheets, with the following columns:

1. File Name


2. File Path


3. Class Name


4. Method / Function Name


5. Line Number


6. Exact logger.info statement


7. Log Message (resolved static text, if available)


8. Variables / Placeholders used in the log


9. Purpose / Context of the log (based on surrounding code)



Output the result as:

A CSV-style table (comma-separated)

Or a Markdown table that I can directly paste into Excel


Please include all modules and sub-directories in the scan and make sure no logger.info usage is missed.

Do not modify the code. This is strictly a read-only analysis.

✅ If you want a lightweight version (manager-friendly, quicker)

Use this shorter one:

> Scan the entire project and list all logger.info usages in a single table with:

File Name

File Path

Line Number

Logger Message


Output in CSV or Excel-ready format.

✅ Extra tip (very useful in VS Code)

Before running Copilot:

Open any Java file (or main language file)

Then run the prompt — Copilot uses workspace context better



---

✅ Optional: How to make it look professional for your manager

After Copilot gives the table, tell it:

> Reformat this into a clean Excel-ready sheet with clear column headers and remove duplicate log messages.

If you want, I can also:

✅ Create a Python/Node script to auto-extract logs

✅ Format it exactly like a compliance / audit sheet

✅ Help you add log-level rationalization (INFO vs DEBUG vs ERROR)


Just tell me 👍

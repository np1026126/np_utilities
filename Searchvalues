Got it. Here's a professional escalation mail version with the additional points you mentioned, keeping the tone neutral but clearly highlighting the impact on delivery and team bandwidth:

Subject: Escalation on Task Delays and Resource Utilization Concerns

Dear [Manager's Name],

I would like to bring to your attention some challenges related to the tasks assigned to [Colleague's Name], which are impacting timelines and team productivity.

Tasks Assigned

1. Anticipated Load Calculator Screens (AC flow – RPP, RPP Panel-based) and its equivalent on the UNO Screen.


2. HVAC New Heat Load Integration – Updating the new heat load instance for wireless locations to Cyrus DB and syncing back to DC Track on Submit.



Concerns Observed

Repeated Delays Despite Guidance:
Despite multiple walkthroughs and clarifications, the same issues resurface repeatedly. We have had to spend significant time explaining both technical details and functional requirements multiple times, yet the progress remains limited.

Overdependence on Other Team Members:
Tasks assigned to [Colleague's Name] are often reassigned to other team members due to lack of progress. This creates additional workload for others who are already managing critical deliverables, leading to overall delays.

Technical & Functional Gaps:
While attempting the anticipated load calculator, the same DC logic was used for AC flow, causing failures. Even after corrections, difficulties persisted in integrating APIs between frontend and backend services. There were also challenges in debugging code generated through Copilot, with limited understanding of why certain implementations were used.

Time Investment vs. Output:
A disproportionate amount of time has been spent clarifying and re-explaining tasks, which has reduced our bandwidth for other high-priority activities. This has delayed dependent tasks and affected delivery timelines.


Current Status

Task #2 (HVAC Integration) has been reassigned due to lack of progress.

Task #1 (Anticipated Load Calculator) is partially complete but pending full integration on the UNO screen.


Recommendation

Given the repeated delays and increased dependency on other team members, I recommend:

1. Reassigning pending work to ensure project timelines are not compromised.


2. Providing additional technical mentoring/training for [Colleague's Name] before allocating similar tasks in the future.


3. Limiting dependency on this resource for time-sensitive deliverables until necessary skill gaps are addressed.



Please advise on how you would like to proceed so that we can plan the remaining work effectively.

Regards,
[Your Name]

If you want, I can also prepare a Slack escalation message that is shorter but professional, in case your manager prefers quick updates over chat.

Do you want me to draft the Slack version as well?

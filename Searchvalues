Got it 👍
Now this is very clear and mature analysis work. You are not asking Copilot/Gemini to just group by status — you want reason-driven, insight-driven categorization, similar to Cancelled PSE analysis, but for In-Progress PSEs, using two inputs:
Log CSV → detailed workflow + reasoning text
Status CSV → current in-progress status snapshot
And the output should answer:
👉 “Why are these PSEs still in progress, what is blocking them, and what can be improved?”
Below is a strong, production-quality Copilot prompt you can directly paste into Copilot Chat (VS Code / Excel Copilot / Web Copilot).
✅ FINAL COPILOT PROMPT (Use This As-Is)
I am sharing two CSV files:
File 1 – PSE_Log_History.csv
Contains workflow logs for PSE jobs
Columns include:
pse_job_id
log_time
log_entry / status_description (free-text reasoning, comments, workflow steps)
File 2 – PSE_InProgress_Status.csv
Contains the current snapshot of PSEs that are In Progress
Columns include:
pse_job_id
current_status (examples: PS Planner Input, Send Back to Requestor, Waiting for Reviews, PSE On Hold, etc.)
Metadata like created date, location, owner (if present)
Objective
Perform a reason-based categorization of In-Progress PSEs, similar in depth and quality to a Cancelled PSE root-cause analysis.
These PSEs are not completed or cancelled, but are stuck or progressing slowly at different workflow stages.
Key Requirement (Very Important)
Do NOT categorize purely based on current_status.
Instead:
Use current_status only as a signal
Use the log history and reasoning text from File 1 to determine:
Why the PSE is still in progress
What is blocking movement to the next step
Analysis Logic
For each pse_job_id:
Identify the latest log entry
Review recent historical logs to understand:
Send-back reasons
Hold reasons
Review delays
Planner input gaps
Rework cycles
Infer the primary blocker / improvement area
Expected Categorization (You may refine names)
Categorize In-Progress PSEs into reason-based buckets, such as:
Incomplete / Incorrect Initial Request
Missing Planner / Engineering Input
Repeated Send-Back / Rework Cycle
Waiting on Review / Approval Bandwidth
External Dependency / On-Hold Constraints
Data Quality or Template Gaps
Ownership or Hand-off Delays
Process Ambiguity (Unclear Next Step)
Output Required
1. In-Progress PSE Categorization Summary
Provide a table with:
Category
Number of PSEs
Percentage of total In-Progress PSEs
2. Category-wise Details
For each category:
List of pse_job_ids
Typical log/reason patterns observed
Example log snippets (summarized, not raw)
3. Key Insights
Highlight:
Top reasons PSEs remain in progress
Common workflow stages causing delays
Patterns like repeated send-back or long planner input waits
4. Improvement Recommendations
For each category, suggest actionable improvements, such as:
Intake form or validation enhancements
Mandatory fields or auto-checks
Clear ownership or SLA definition
Training or documentation gaps
Workflow automation opportunities
Guidelines
Use only evidence from logs, not assumptions
Treat these insights as process improvement opportunities, not individual performance issues
Present output in a business-review friendly format, suitable for leadership or governance forums
If helpful, suggest standardized category names that can be reused across Cancelled and In-Progress PSE reporting.
✅ Why This Prompt Will Work (Important for You)
Forces Copilot to:
Correlate two datasets
Do semantic reasoning, not keyword grouping
Produce cancelled-style insights, not raw status reports
Prevents shallow output like:
“5 PSEs are in Planner Input”
Drives output like:
“Planner input delays are primarily due to missing HVAC load clarity and repeated send-back cycles.”
✅ Pro Tip (Before Uploading Files)
Ensure pse_job_id matches exactly in both CSVs
Log file should include reason text, not just status codes
No need to pre-sort — Copilot can infer latest timestamps
If you want next, I can:
Align Cancelled vs In-Progress categories into one unified framework
Help you turn this into 1 executive slide
Convert Copilot output into metrics + charts
Draft a strong narrative for leadership review
Just tell me 👍

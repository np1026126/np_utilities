AC Power Calculation Flow – Migration Approach

Slide 1 – Calculation Flow Overview

Title: Anticipated Load Calculation & Roll-up Logic

How it works (Step-by-Step):

User Action: Select RPP panel(s) for new equipment load (e.g., 5 kW).

At RPP Panel Level: Anticipated Load = Current Consumed + New Job Load.

At RPP Level: Sum of anticipated loads from all panels under the RPP.

At PDU Level: Sum of anticipated loads of all RPPs connected to that PDU.

At UPS Bank Level: Sum of anticipated loads of all PDUs connected to the UPS Bank.


Key Points:

Anticipated load is first calculated at RPP panel level.

Roll-up happens bottom-up → Panel → RPP → PDU → UPS Bank.

Current Consumed values are fetched from dcTrack.

Anticipated load is stored in custom fields in dcTrack.

Each update recalculates totals and syncs back asynchronously.


Formula Simplified:

Panel: New = Previous Anticipated + New Job Load

RPP: New = Σ Panel Loads

PDU: New = Σ RPP Loads

UPS Bank: New = Σ PDU Loads

Slide 2 – When & How It Happens

When Calculations Occur:

1. Preview Stage (UI): Live calculation before save.


2. Save Stage: New values committed → Panel/RPP/PDU/UPS Bank updated.


3. Edit Stage: Previous allocations adjusted, recalculated, and rolled up.


4. Sync Stage: Updated values pushed asynchronously to dcTrack.



Design Principles:

Bottom-up aggregation ensures accuracy.

Anticipated load percentage applied based on in-service date rules.

Async sync prevents UI delays.

Open Jobs View: Users can see all active jobs affecting the same panel/RPP.



---

✅ Outcome:

Transparent load calculation at each level.

Prevents over-allocation by showing utilization impacts instantly.

Ensures consistency between Cyrus and dcTrack inventories.

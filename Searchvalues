Got it 👍
What you want is not an explanation, but a clean, polished way to ask these questions on the call, without sounding confused, confrontational, or too technical-heavy.
Below is a refined, ready-to-say call script, broken into logical questions, using simple language, but still accurate for C&G / IFP / FUSE / PSE / PSR context.
You can read this almost as-is on the call.
🎯 How to ask this on the 1:1 call (polished & structured)
🔹 Opening context (30–40 seconds)
You can start like this:
“I wanted to understand the flow post-PSE completion from your side, so that we’re aligned on how things are actually being done today and where we should focus next.”
🔹 Question 1: What happens after PSE & vetting?
“Once the PSE is completed and the vetting is done in 1KC, what does the next step look like from your side?”
👉 This lets them explain naturally, without you assuming anything.
🔹 Question 2: Current process in C&G
“From there, how does the work move into C&G today? What activities are you currently performing in C&G after vetting?”
👉 This reveals:
Whether C&G is execution-heavy
Or mostly tracking / approvals
🔹 Question 3: PSR alignment check (very important)
“We see that PSRs are being set up for each FUSE ID or FUSE project ID. From your perspective, does that align with how the process is executed in C&G, or is there anything additional that happens outside of that?”
👉 This checks whether:
PSR = reality
Or PSR is only partial representation
🔹 Question 4: Comparison with IFP / FUSE
“Is this post-vetting flow similar to what you were earlier doing in IFP or FUSE, or are there differences in how the work gets completed?”
👉 This naturally brings out:
What IFP still does better
What has changed
What is duplicated
🔹 Question 5: Why IFP is still being used (key gap question)
“In which scenarios do you still need to go back to IFP today, and what typically drives that decision?”
👉 This is the most important question
Do not interrupt here.
🔹 Question 6: Gap identification (future-focused)
“From your point of view, what are the gaps today that prevent everything from being completed within the new application, especially for MSC?”
👉 This frames gaps as system gaps, not user issues.
🔹 Question 7: Next-phase prioritization
“If we were to address these in the next phase, what would you say are the top areas we should focus on so that, at least for MSC, there’s no dependency on IFP?”
👉 This gives you clear roadmap inputs.
🔹 Closing (positive & collaborative)
“This really helps us understand where to focus next. We’ll take this back and see how we can close these gaps in upcoming phases.”
🧠 Why this works
❌ No accusation (“why are you still using IFP?”)
❌ No assumption
✅ Lets user explain real workflow
✅ Clearly surfaces gaps
✅ Gives you MSC-specific improvement direction
📝 Pro tip for you
During the call, note answers under 4 headings:
What happens after vetting
What is done in C&G
Why IFP is still used
Gaps for MSC completion
This will make your post-call summary extremely strong.

Perfect — since this is a 15-minute one-on-one call, the key is to ask open, neutral, workflow-based questions, not feedback-style questions.
Below is a ready-to-use call flow + exact questions, timed so you don’t overrun.
🕒 15-Minute One-on-One Call Structure
⏱️ 0–2 mins: Warm opening (very important)
Purpose: make him comfortable, not defensive.
You can say:
“Thanks for taking the time. This is just a quick sync to understand how things are working post-migration and to align on next improvements. Nothing formal.”
⏱️ 2–6 mins: Understand current usage (NO judgment)
Question 1 – daily workflow
“On a typical day, how are you currently using the new application, especially around the 1KC vetting flow?”
👉 This tells you:
Adoption level
Where 1KC fits in their real work
Question 2 – effort reduction (positive framing)
“Compared to earlier, what parts of your work feel a bit easier or quicker now?”
👉 This extracts wins without asking “what do you like?”
⏱️ 6–10 mins: Gently surface gaps (this is the key part)
Question 3 – friction points (neutral)
“Are there any steps today that still feel manual or require extra follow-up?”
👉 This reveals pain points without blame
Question 4 – old application usage (very important)
“In which scenarios do you still need to go back to IFP, and what typically triggers that?”
👉 This tells you:
Missing features
Trust gaps
Data gaps
Habit-based usage
📌 Do not interrupt here — let him talk.
⏱️ 10–13 mins: Improvement-oriented (future-focused)
Question 5 – improvement framing
“If we were to improve just one thing in the next phase, what would make the biggest difference for you?”
👉 This gives you priority guidance, not complaints.
Optional follow-up (if time allows)
“Is there anything in the current 1KC process that feels unclear or could be simplified further?”
⏱️ 13–15 mins: Close positively
Closing line you can use:
“This is really helpful. We’ll take this back and see how we can close these gaps on our side. If anything else comes to mind later, feel free to ping us.”
🧠 Why this question set works
❌ No “Please give feedback”
❌ No “Are you satisfied?”
✅ Focuses on workflow reality
✅ Encourages honesty
✅ Naturally explains why IFP is still used
✅ Gives you actionable inputs
📝 Tip for you (very important)
During the call, note answers under these headers:
What works well
What reduced effort

Improvement suggestions
This makes your post-call summary very strong.

Here’s a refined professional version of your reply that naturally includes that context:

Hi [Manager’s Name], good morning.
I wasn’t aware that a call was scheduled last night. Sharath called me around 9 PM, and that’s when I got to know about it. Around the same time, I was already on a call with Aravind discussing some open issues — since it’s a local holiday in Bangalore, we were aligning to ensure yesterday’s work isn’t impacted.

Later, we also had a quick discussion with Dheeraj to review the current status. That’s why I couldn’t join the scheduled call.

Please let me know if there’s anything important I need to follow up on from that discussion.

Thanks,
Naveen

Would you like me to make a Slack-friendly short version that sounds more conversational but still polite?

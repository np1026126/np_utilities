Here’s a clean clarification you can send about the “New Utilization” section in the sheet:

Subject: Clarification on “New anticipated … load” used in New Utilization (UPS / PDU / RPP)

Team, could you please confirm which interpretation is correct for the “new anticipated … load” used in the New Utilization formulas?

Option A – Direct (PSE-level add-on at each tier)

New anticipated UPS load = (current PSE anticipated load) + (previous anticipated UPS load)

New anticipated PDU load = (current PSE anticipated load at that PDU) + (previous anticipated PDU load)

New anticipated RPP load = (current PSE anticipated load at that RPP / panel) + (previous anticipated RPP load)


> In this approach we add the PSE’s anticipated load directly at each tier, using each tier’s previous anticipated value as the baseline.



Option B – Hierarchical roll-up (bottom-up accumulation)

1. Compute RPP: sum all panel/RPP anticipated loads (including the current PSE) → new anticipated RPP load


2. Compute PDU: sum all new anticipated RPP loads under that PDU → new anticipated PDU load


3. Compute UPS: sum all new anticipated PDU loads under the UPS/UPS-bank → new anticipated UPS load



> In this approach, we only inject the PSE’s anticipated load at the panel/RPP level and roll it up RPP → PDU → UPS.



Our current design favors Option B (bottom-up roll-up) for consistency and to avoid double-counting, but we will align with your intended definition.
Please confirm which option you want us to implement (or share the exact formula text if different).

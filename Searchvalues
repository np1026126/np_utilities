Here’s a polished Slack message you can send to Jessica — concise, professional, and matching your context perfectly 👇


---

Hi Jessica,
Since we couldn’t connect earlier, I’ve sent a detailed mail covering:

The list of changes required for both AC and DC assets,

Clarifications for the specific asset-related queries raised, and

The sample templates for the additional upstream assets.


Please check your inbox for the full summary — I’ve included all supporting documents as you requested.


---

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter variant (2–3 lines) for use as a reply in the same thread under Jessica’s last message, so it reads naturally in Slack?
---

Note:
Across all assets, the Location Name column has inconsistencies.
If possible, omit the “Location Name” column from input.
If it must be provided, please use the format:
<CLLICode> <space> <RoomName>
—for example: NWBLWICZ Switch Room 1 100.

Attachments included:

1. Clarification Document: Queries and clarifications raised on load devices and other assets.


2. AC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis (comparison of Site Survey vs Holistic data).


3. DC Flow – New Berlin Asset Analysis (comparison of Site Survey vs Holistic data).


4. Sample Templates for Transformer, ATS Switchboard, and Load Devices to be used for completing missing upstream assets.



Please review and update the corresponding sheets accordingly.

Regards,
Naveen Prasad

Would you like me to make a slightly shorter Slack-style version (2-3 crisp paragraphs) of this same message so you can post a heads-up to users before sending the email?

✅ Copilot Prompt to Filter HVAC Data Based on CLLI Codes

> I have two Excel sheets:

1. Sheet 1 (HVAC_holistic_generated)
  – Column Location contains values in the format: "CLLICODE > Room Name"
  – I want to filter this data to keep only rows where the CLLI code portion (i.e., the text before the '>' symbol) matches any value from the list in Sheet 2.


2. Sheet 2 (missing_hvac_locationcodes)
  – Contains one column named ClliCode with 8 specific codes.



✅ Please perform the following:

For each row in Sheet 1, extract the CLLI code part from the Location column (i.e., the text before '>' symbol and any extra spaces).

Compare this extracted CLLI code with the list in Sheet 2.

Keep only the rows from Sheet 1 where the extracted CLLI code matches any of the 8 codes in Sheet 2.

Remove all other rows from Sheet 1.


✅ Output:
A filtered version of HVAC_holistic_generated sheet with only the matching CLLI codes and their corresponding rows.

This prompt ensures Copilot knows exactly what to extract, how to compare using only the part before '>', and what output to return.


The updated version of New_Load_Panel_Breaker_Sheet.csv with Columns N and M populated wherever applicable.

Let me know if you want to script this in Python or Excel formulas as well.

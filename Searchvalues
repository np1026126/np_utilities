Subject: Request for 30-Minute Working Session on Busway/Tab Box Connections and HVAC Zone Creation

Hi [Recipient Names],

As part of the ongoing migration to DC Track, I’m encountering a few challenges that I would like to review in a focused working session:

1. Busway and Asset Creation

In some cases, there are no PDUs or RPPs, only a Busway. I need clarity on how PDUs and UPS can be created from Busway, and how Busway and tab boxes are connected to breakers in such scenarios.

Understanding the correct method of connecting Busway, tab boxes, and breakers during asset creation.



2. HVAC Cooling Unit and Zone Creation

In certain cases, HVAC zones are created automatically when adding a cooling unit, but in other cases, they are not. I need help identifying why this discrepancy occurs and how to address it.




Could we set up a 30-minute call tomorrow at any time convenient for you to go through these points in detail? Please confirm your availability so I can send a calendar invite.

Thank you for your time and support.

Best regards,
Naveen Prasad Natarajan

If you want, I can also make a concise version for Slack so you can follow up there if they don’t respond to the email quickly. Would you like me to prepare that too?

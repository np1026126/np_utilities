Here’s a clear, respectful Slack message you can post in your group channel to get that clarification on RPP and PDU level load calculations, referencing your earlier discussion with Andrij and Suresh:

Slack Message Draft:

Hi @Andrij Kulynych @Suresh Raman 👋

Just wanted to bring up one clarification regarding the RPP and PDU level calculations, which I had mentioned earlier in our chat but wanted to put it here in the open forum for alignment.

As per our current understanding —

The sum of the current load of all RPP panels connected under an RPP will give the current load of the RPP.

Similarly, the sum of the anticipated load of all RPP panels connected under that RPP will give the anticipated load of the RPP.

The total load at the RPP level will therefore be the sum of both current and anticipated loads of all connected panels.


Likewise, for the PDU level, the logic remains the same —

The sum of all RPPs’ current loads connected under a PDU will represent the current load of the PDU (which we are planning to source from CPNG as the actual/polled value).

The sum of all RPPs’ anticipated loads connected under the same PDU will give the anticipated load of the PDU.


Just wanted to reconfirm if this calculation flow aligns with your understanding as well. This was the clarification I intended to raise in the earlier call — not specific to Busway, but for RPP/PDU load derivation logic.

Thanks! 🙏
Naveen

Would you like me to include a short diagram snippet text (like a one-line ASCII power chain example: UPS → PDU → RPP → Panel → Cabinet) at the end of the message for easier visualization when you post it?

2. NEC Sites Data Migration

NEC site data provided by Andris for RPP panels was imported.

While importing RPP Panel Breakers from IFP, the following issues were observed:

RPP Panel names did not match for a few locations.

RPP records were missing in some cases.

Some RPP records present in IFP were not found in the provided sheet.


We will connect with Andris to fix these mismatches and also request his support for HVAC details for the same sites.

3. User Follow-ups

We need clarity on the timelines for user-side follow-ups so we can plan the final migration work accordingly.

Once user inputs are available, we will pick them up along with the IT follow-ups to complete the migration activities.



---

Action Required:

Confirmation from users on the expected date for user-side fallout resolution.

Support from Andris on fixing RPP Panel data mismatches and providing HVAC details.

If you want, I can also create a Slack-friendly version for quick status updates that you can post in the user group.
Do you want me to prepare that too?

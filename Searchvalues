Yes 👍 — every database provides a way to list all indexes, but the query depends on which database you are using.

Since in your work you mostly use PostgreSQL (Verizon projects, DC-Track, migrations), I’ll start with that clearly, and then also give MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server for completeness.

✅ PostgreSQL – List ALL Indexes in the Database

🔹 1. List all indexes (simple & most-used)

SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;

✔ Gives:

Schema name

Table name

Index name

Full index definition (very useful for audits / performance review)



---

🔹 2. List indexes with index type (BTREE, GIN, etc.)

SELECT
    ns.nspname AS schema_name,
    tbl.relname AS table_name,
    idx.relname AS index_name,
    am.amname AS index_type
FROM pg_class idx
JOIN pg_index i ON i.indexrelid = idx.oid
JOIN pg_class tbl ON tbl.oid = i.indrelid
JOIN pg_namespace ns ON ns.oid = tbl.relnamespace
JOIN pg_am am ON idx.relam = am.oid
ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;

✔ Helpful when checking:

BTREE vs GIN vs GiST

Index strategy issues



---

🔹 3. Indexes for a specific table

SELECT
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'your_table_name';


---

🔹 4. Index size (important for large DBs)

SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass)) AS index_size
FROM pg_indexes
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexname::regclass) DESC;

✔ Very useful for:

Identifying bloated indexes

Cleanup during migration



---

✅ MySQL – List Indexes

🔹 All indexes in all tables

SELECT
    TABLE_SCHEMA,
    TABLE_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME,
    COLUMN_NAME,
    INDEX_TYPE
FROM information_schema.STATISTICS
ORDER BY TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME;


---

✅ Oracle – List Indexes

SELECT
    OWNER,
    TABLE_NAME,
    INDEX_NAME,
    INDEX_TYPE
FROM ALL_INDEXES
ORDER BY OWNER, TABLE_NAME;


---

✅ SQL Server – List Indexes

SELECT
    s.name AS schema_name,
    t.name AS table_name,
    i.name AS index_name,
    i.type_desc AS index_type
FROM sys.indexes i
JOIN sys.tables t ON i.object_id = t.object_id
JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id
WHERE i.name IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;

📌 Best Recommendation (for your use case)

Since you often:

Share data with managers

Do migrations

Review performance issues


👉 Use PostgreSQL Query #1, export it to CSV/Excel, and share it.

If you want, I can also:

📄 Give you a COPY TO CSV version

📊 Create an Excel-friendly query

⚡ Help identify unused or duplicate indexes

🧠 Explain which indexes are actually used (pg_stat_user_indexes)


Just tell me:

> Which DB exactly (Postgres / MySQL / Oracle / SQL Server)?

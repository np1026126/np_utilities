Thanks! Based on your explanation, here is a professional email draft you can send to Sivajyothi and Manasa, clearly explaining the code coverage issue, the difference between local (JekaCo) and Sonar, and what action is needed from them:

üìß Subject: Action Required: Sonar Code Coverage Below Threshold ‚Äì Please Review Your Changes

Hi Sivajyothi and Manasa,

Hope you're doing well.

As observed in the recent Sonar scan for the psc-common-service, the code coverage on new code has fallen below the 90% threshold, causing the Sonar stage to fail in SIT.

Upon checking, the impacted files are related to your recent changes, and the details have already been highlighted by the DevOps team in their email.

üîç Key Points to Note:

While local execution via JekaCo shows a higher overall file coverage, it does not differentiate between existing code and new changes.

Sonar, however, compares your latest changes against the master branch and focuses only on the new lines added or modified.

Even if only 2 out of 5 lines are uncovered, the coverage percentage will drop significantly due to the small number of total lines added.

Additionally, Sonar also checks whether all logical conditions in your lines are fully covered, not just whether the line was executed.


üìå Action Required: Kindly review your test cases and ensure that:

1. All new lines introduced by your changes are covered.


2. Any conditions or branches within those lines are also tested appropriately.


3. Once done, please push the updated test cases and notify the team.



Let us know once this is taken care of, so we can proceed with further deployment steps.

Thanks for your support!

Best regards,
Naveen Prasad
